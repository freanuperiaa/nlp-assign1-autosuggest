      "@@5453821 On October 13 , 2008 , Filmkameratene AS received an anonymous package with two hard disks containing 283 minutes of filmed material . This film is a rough-cut version of that material . Everything is shown in chronological order and no images have been manipulated . A team of investigators spent more than a year trying to establish whether this was a practical joke or if the material was authentic . They concluded that it was authentic . Ready ? Turn on the radio . - Johanna , do you have sound ? - Yes . This is n't working . Bear tracks were found yesterday in Volda . A hunting party arrived there today . The leader of the hunting party had the following to say : We expect to locate this bear fairly quickly . Our real concern is that a poacher has been following us . Only a select few ever get bear-hunting licenses . I know every single bear hunter in Norway . That guy in the Land Rover is no bear hunter . If he 's gunning for our bear , he 's breaking the law . - Have you ever seen him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again , there 'll be consequences . He 's nothing but a poacher . - What would you like to tell him ? - To lay his cards on the table . Drive ! - There 's too much traffic . - We 're going to lose him ! Ready ? We know his name is Hans , but we have no last name . Thomas , try being more serious . But what is he doing in Volda ? Who is he ? - Do we have sound ? - You have n't plugged in the ... You wo n't get an interview with a poacher . I do n't like it when you ridicule him . That 's great ! Thank you . Bye . Thomas , that poacher is staying at the campground ! I ca n't say I know him , but he is here . He 's staying right over here . Want me to show you ? I do n't know what that smell is , but his camper sure reeks ! - What are all those things ? - I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night . He 's never back before sunrise . - He stays out all night ? - Yes . Every night . - In good spirits ? - Sure . We do n't know when or if he 'll show up . - There he is ! - I 'm filming . Just ask him directly . Hi . My name 's Thomas . We 're from Volda College . Could we ask you a few questions ? Get lost . Maybe we could come back ... - Did it work ? - Quiet , I hear something . Yes , I 'm on my way out now . I expect to find it tonight . Okay , fine . Bye . - He is n't here . - He was right in front of us ! Sure , but ... - Shit ! - Nice work , Thomas . - Can you see anything ? - Yeah . Some furry things are hanging down from the ceiling . And there 's a shotgun . We 're on our way to where a bear was just found shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one came from . I 've checked with every registered bear hunter I know . None of them shot this one . The bear population is managed by the state . So a downed bear like this one causes quite a fuss . Look at this . These tracks do n't match the way a bear normally walks . I think someone brought this bear and dumped it here . - That 's weird . - I agree . Very weird . You 're from the Wildlife Board . Finn Haugan , right ? These hunters say those are n't bear tracks . That 's ridiculous . What else would they be ? There is a bear right there , with tracks all around it . - But why are they in doubt ? - Ask them ! It 's crazy . We have waited for Hans for hours , but now he 's finally moving . We think he 's heading somewhere , and we are going to follow him . Go ! It looks like he 's heading for the ferry . How long are we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's carrying ? It 's a car tire . - What 's he doing ? - I ca n't tell . Three , two , one , and ... Sogn og Fjordane county ! Okay , he 's over there . Just hide here . We met a little while back . - Really ? - Thomas , from Volda College . - Is that ... - Are you following me ? We just want to ask you a couple of questions . No . Are you ... What were you doing in Volda ? Did you shoot that bear ? Stay the hell away from me . Turn that off . Leave me alone ! Once we get what we need , we can go back . It would be so awesome to get him to talk . We have tried , plenty of times . Do you think Michael Moore gave up after the first try ? Left arm or right foot ? The one you kick with ? We have been here all afternoon . I think he 's sleeping in his trailer . So now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to get my sound gear . What is this ? \" No trespassing . Blasting area . \" Did you see that ? Was that a road ? Did you ? This road is horrible . If we run into a bunch of inbred pig farmers , your ass is first ... - I 'm not ... - Stop whining . - I 'm just being honest . - Want to go back ? - Fine by me . - That 's not what I meant . Hey , wait for me ! Look here . I do n't think he 's in his car . - So we know he 's here ... - But what is he up to ? Here 's a trail . - I hear something in the distance . - What ? Troll ! Thomas ! Hurry ! My car is right over here ! - What ? - Something bit me ! - Are you all right ? - It stings . - You heard him yell \" troll , \" right ? - Shut up . You need some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauze in the first-aid kit . - Ow ! Do n't ... - We have to get this out . You look like hell , Thomas . - What the hell was that ? - Tetanus shot . You yelled something back there in the woods . - You heard him , Johanna . - What 's this slime ? What did he say ? - More ? - Yes . Can you give us a ride to our car ? It is n't very smart to follow me . Did you yell \" troll \" out there ? - Is that your car ? - What the hell ? - What happened ? - That 's our car ! Someone crushed our car . It 's completely demolished . Look at this , Thomas . - Hans , do you understand this ? - I have an idea . Okay , what ... A bear did n't do this . What do you think happened ? - What ... - Ask him if a troll did it . Hey , if you know what happened to my car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \" - Forget about that ! What the hell do you want ? You want me to say trolls exist , on film ? - You find that funny ? - No , but you do n't actually believe ... If you want a ride , you 'd better come right now . - What should we do ? - I think I 'll walk . You have our bags ? Just so we get this straight : You actually believe trolls exist ? Why are you so sure it was a bear that attacked you ? What 's the matter ? Why are we stopping ? Thanks for giving us a ride . We 'd love to join you , and film what you do . We 'd be very interested . I 'll let you film me killing whatever scratched you , on one condition : You do exactly as I say , no matter what I say . Okay ? Yes . I feel like I 'm bleeding everywhere . - Are you admiring your wound ? - Yuck ! Do n't film that ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why call them ? - To tell them where we are . He is n't dangerous , just weird . Remember , he runs the show . We do exactly as he says . Then we 'll get our footage . No one here believes in God or Jesus ? Nope . None of us . Do n't look at me . Serious ? Because they can smell \" the blood of a Christian man \" ? Is that alright ? Close the gate and hang up that sign . NO TRESPASSING . BLASTING AREA . - Is this a land mine ? - Yes . But it is n't armed . I 'm sitting on a land mine ? Are you nuts ? Anyone who does n't want to join me ? Who 's changed their mind ? Who 's afraid of trolls ? - No . - No ? Good . Go down to that creek , take off all your clothes , and scrub yourselves . - Especially your armpits and groin . - No way ! - Why ? - To remove any body odor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - What is that ? - Troll stench . - Rub it all over your bodies . - It reeks ! No way . Forget about it . You have to smell like a troll , or they 'll smell us and run away . Christ ! - No . No way ! - I 'm not doing this , Thomas . Forget about it ! You agreed to do exactly as I said . If you do n't do it , I 'll go up there alone and leave you here . Is that understood ? Are you ready ? You 're all greased up ? You look cute . Here , flashlights for you . - What is that ? - A big flash bulb , basically . Hans ? That weapon . How do you use it ? It blasts a powerful ultraviolet beam . UVB rays . The same as the sun , or a tanning lamp . Do n't you know sunlight turns them to stone , Thomas ? - Right . Or they explode . - Have n't you read anything ? I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you know that , Kalle ? So , what do you do if a troll wants to have an eating contest with you ? Eating contest ? Fairy tales usually do n't match reality . They seem to in this case . - Troll piss . - Christ ! You can smell it all the way over here . Listen , I 'm hunting a Ringlefinch . There 's piss everywhere . He 's marking . Looks like he 's been chased from his territory . He seems sick . I 'd like to find out what 's wrong with him . A blood sample from the troll ? I do n't have the right equipment . You too . Bye . I need help to find out what 's wrong . But a blood sample ... That wo n't be easy . Who were you talking to ? A veterinarian . A vet ! If you wait here , I 'll try to chase the troll out . Is this what you imagined ? I bet it 's going to take him some time to find a troll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really believes in trolls . Maybe he 's filming us . - That 's probably what he 's doing . - He 's somewhere laughing at us . While we sit here like idiots . Lingonberry ? - In the woods ? - Yes , with no food or water . - Cool ! - What ? It 's a night-vision camera . Listen ! That 's just him . One week , or being bitten by a bear . - It makes for a good story . - You would look ridiculous ! - So I think I 'll choose that . - Being bitten by a bear ? Do you feel that ? I 'm picking up some strange sounds . What is that ? Seriously . What 's going on ? What is this ? This is one real bad joke . It 's a Tosserlad ! Get the hell out of here ! Run , dammit ! - Did you see that ? - Yes . Where did it go ? Do you see it ? Get behind my car ! No ! - Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas ! Kalle ! - Johanna ! - It 's real ! I told you so ! I knew it ! They are real ! - Say something . - It 's been turned to stone ! We ran through the woods ... Why the hell did you say that none of you were Christian ? The way that troll sniffed around ... Obviously one of you believes in God . I do n't believe in God . I sang in a church teen choir ... But that 's because my parents forced me to . I do n't believe in God . I 'm serious . - I can tell it 's not her . - What ? How ? Knock it off . That was some genetically-engineered monster . - That 's a troll . - Nonsense ! Question ! Why does n't anybody know about this ? Because someone does n't want people to know . The government ? Is the government behind this ? Do you work for them ? - Why show it to us now ? - Because I 'm tired of this shitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no night bonus . No overtime . No nuisance compensation . Maybe it 's time for a change in troll management . - So if you could get this on TV ... - That should n't be a problem . Come on . You want to see more of these , learn what 's really going on ? You might want to step back . Holy shit ! Anyone need some gravel ? Who the hell is that ? - Who is that ? - I do n't know . Hi there . It 's that guy we filmed ... What is this , Hans ? A film crew ? They wanted to see some trolls . Are n't you that guy from the Wildlife Board ? This is an exceptionally bad idea . Turn off that camera . I have enough problems . The valley is full of dead cattle . I ca n't talk about this on film . Turn off that camera . - Put it down . - We 're allowed to film here . - Sure you 're on top of this ? - Totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of the rest . PIOTER 'S POLISH PAINT SERVICE The Ringlefinch is still out there . Then find it ! Two German tourists disappeared last night . - We expect to lose a few more . - That is n't my problem . If you think I 'll let you keep those recordings , you 're wrong ! It says \" Pioter 's Polish Paint Service . \" What exactly is your job description ? My job is to kill any troll that breaks out of its territory - and comes near people . - How often do they break out ? Rarely . This is a special situation . Too many trolls are out and about . Finn is a ... bureaucrat . He works for TSS . His primary job is to prevent ... To keep people from knowing that trolls exist . In one sense , you are a true Norwegian hero . No , you 're wrong about that . There 's nothing heroic about what I do . It 's dirty work . How can no one know about this ? Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a fortune . We ca n't do that yet . We have to keep following him . Finn is pissed off . - Now what ? - Breakfast . - You should eat something too . - I 'm not hungry . I feel a little ... nauseous . How many types of troll are there ? You have two main groups : Mountain trolls and woodland trolls . The subgroups include Ringlefinch , Tosserlad , Rimetosser . Mountain Kings . The Harding , out west . But that troll we saw ... Do they all have three heads ? No , there are many variations . The heads develop as they age . They are n't born with three . They are usually born with one . The others appear later . They only have an eye in the middle , the original , head . The other heads are n't really heads . They 're a sort of protuberance . Their function is to scare other trolls . Or impress the females . What is that form ? - What does TSS stand for ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form after each kill . Location , gender , whether it blew up or turned to stone ... SLAYED TROLL FORM In fairy tales , trolls wear clothes and talk like people . - They 're just like people . - Fairy tales are for kids . Trolls are animals . Predators . They eat , shit and mate . Eat anything they can . - How old can trolls get ? - 1000 , 1200 years . - And their intelligence level ? - In the pits . They are not bright . They manage to eat . But how hard is it to survive on rocks ? I once saw a troll try to eat its own tail . His head between his legs , he tried to suck down his own tail . He started gagging on it , tipped over and rolled down a hill like a wheel . - I was a Navy Ranger . - And that led you to troll hunting ? No , they were looking for someone who could ... - So you 're the only one in Norway ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of crap . - Do they eat people ? - You want to offer yourself ? - No . But have they eaten people ? - Are those troll tails ? - Yes . Some skinned , some whole . - Why ? - So it smells like troll in here . Why do you want a troll smell ? So I can approach the trolls without them noticing . - Tanning lamps ? - Yes . - You can get skin cancer . - I use sunscreen . I have trouble sleeping in the dark . - Is that what we rubbed on ourselves ? - Yes . - What is it ? - Concentrated troll stench . A mixture of all the crap you can squeeze out of a troll . Let 's go find that Ringlefinch before he eats every animal in the county . Two German tourists were found killed by a bear . Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board is investigating the tragedy . Do you know where the troll might be ? No . What are you looking for ? Rock slides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Do I look like that famous painting ? - Yeah . Maybe you should see a doctor ? - Do you really feel sick ? - It comes and goes . - Are we safe here ? - They only come out at night . Kalle , ca n't we ... It has n't been triggered . Some small trolls have taken the bait . Concrete and charcoal is an unbeatable combination . - Do it now ! - Now ? Hans thinks he has found the trail of a Ringlefinch ... Hans thinks he has found tracks . Some farmers have found sheep carcasses nearby . Hans thinks there 's a link between the two . Hurry up ! Global warming has led to changes in our flora and fauna . These tracks you see around here ... are from a Russian bear that came through Finland and Sweden . The bear stores its food here under the bridge . - Is n't that strange behavior ? - Not for Russian bears . Due to the long , hard winters , they store their food . Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the left foot . And the right foot is over here . Has the bear walked cross-legged ? I assume you have seen bear tracks before . Hey , what about those tracks ? He 's gnawed at the bark . Typical Ringlefinch behavior . He 'll be back tonight . I have something to lure him with . - And then you 'll kill him ? - Yes . But first , I need to get that blood sample . Is this the syringe ? This is horrible ! It 's cruelty to animals . Cruelty ? He 's just using them as bait . You 're too far away . Move closer . No , I 'll just zoom . We can see fine from here . What working hours ... We 've been here forever . Maybe no troll will show up ? - We can see fine from here . - But we can see better from there ! Come on . It 's here . Hear that ? Run ! God , I hate this crap ! Keep your distance . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move back ! Shit ! Kalle ! Thomas ! Move ! Move over ! Are you alright ? Hey ... Are you alright ? Help him up . - Come on , Hans . - Are you alright ? Careful with that red button . Give me the syringe . Stay up there . Now we know that trolls also explode . - How are you doing ? - Fine , thanks . Could 've been worse . Just a little sore . A little sore ? This is crazy ! At least I got the blood sample . I 'll be there in a half hour . Thanks . Bye . You look like a newborn ! It 's just a film team . They have some questions . ? RDAL PET CLINIC - Is that the blood ? - Yes . - It was quite a struggle . - I can tell . You 're a mess ! - Thanks . - There 's a bathroom in there . - What do you see ? - There are n't enough red blood cells . This will take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview ? If you could just stand ... or maybe sit over there . - What should I tell them ? - Everything . - We are n't allowed . - I take full responsibility . The trolls ' main problem is that they ca n't convert vitamin D from the sunlight , into calcium . So when they are exposed to bright sunlight , their bodies overreact . Their stomachs expand . Gases are forced into their intestines and veins . This becomes unbearable . - And they explode ? - They explode . - But some trolls turn to stone . - Yes , the older one's . Their veins are too constricted , so the expansion occurs in their bones . In a matter of seconds , everything calcifies and they turn to stone . I wish they did n't have to experience such pain . It is traumatic for them , even though it only takes a few seconds . We would have preferred to give them an injection . - I 'll have the results in a few days . - And you 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ? - Sure . - Why all these local newspapers ? - To collect information . - About what ? - Trolls . Accidents and things that have happened , that trolls are behind . - I have files back there . - Can I take a look ? - \" Road disappeared . \" - People want natural explanations . But if you know what to look for , you 'll see what 's caused by trolls . This bridge was smashed by a wading troll that bumped his head . Are there trolls that big ? Yes , the Jotnar . I 'm the only person to have seen one . There 's a mountain troll territory on the Finnmark plateau . And one on the Hardanger plateau . Three in Jotunheimen , one in Dovre . We have to find out where the problem lies . Jotunheimen is closest . We are on our way to the first territory Hans wants to check . At the moment , we are circling around the territory . The territory ends up here , and because this tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . If they had left , they would have gnawed on this tire . Smile ! Film over there . Trolls love to gnaw on old car tires . One has tried to kick his way into the good stuff here , but failed . - How many trolls are there ? - Impossible to say . You must have some idea ? The gestation period is 10 to 15 years . And they only have one kid . - Are they mammals ? - Yes . Let 's see ... One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . This looks fine . All the stones are in the same position . This is apparently a battle area . Mountain trolls and woodland trolls often come to blows here . They throw stones at each other . But there has been little activity here lately . The guy behind us is paying . Is n't that what they say ? Remember that big Jotnar ? They live here in Jotunheimen . - Where ? - Inside the mountains . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate an entire loaf of bread . Finn refuses to give in . He claims all the runaways are from Dovre . Because he does n't see any in this satellite photo . But you ca n't see trolls in satellite photos ! Let 's get to the bottom of this . We are on our way to a farm that was on the local news recently . Hans thinks it 's troll related . Wow , look at that ! Did you get that ? - What happened here ? - A tornado . - Did you see it happen ? - No . Look at the position of those trees . They should all point in the same direction . Who showed you that map ? They did n't say who they were . But they had fancy weather charts and satellite images . And we saw what looked like a tornado . At least three trolls ran though here and continued northward . How can it be that no one sees huge beasts rampage across a field like this ? We 'll come back tonight . Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like this . - Let 's stick together . Seriously , Kalle . We have to follow him . What do you think we should do ? There are tracks further in . Here 's their trail . They 've passed through here . - We ca n't stay here alone . - This way ! An abandoned mine . - They 've been here . - I 'm not going in there ! There are n't any trolls there now . Come on . - Are you sure ? - Sure . No , there 's nobody home . I need the troll stench . - Here . - I can take the camera . Everything okay ? A whole pack of trolls lives here . This is a lair . - We can leave . - Come on , let 's get out of here ! Let 's go . Come on ! I 'm coming ! Closer to the wall ! Head back inside ! Quick , in here ! Turn off your flashlights ! I have to get out of here . - Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here . Just relax . Breathe easy . Calm down . - Why are you so nervous ? - I 'm Christian ! - We 're going to die ! - Damn ! You 'd better not start sweating ! Dear Lord ... Shut up ! Run ! Sunlight ! It still works . There are more in there . I 'll have to get them later . Mountain Kings . Why did n't he just say he was Christian ? I have to go to Dovre to find out why they keep running away . I can give you a ride down , if you want to quit . - What are you doing ? - Looking for those tapes . In my trailer ? - Are you filming ? - No . - It 's out of control . - Why are n't you up there ? I refuse to go into their territory . There 's no way . - Turn off that camera . - It 's off . But do n't people have a right to know ? - What is your job ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a right to know ? People are dying ! Why is this so secret ? - People have a right to know . - No . - Hands off the camera . - This is none of your business . Yes , this happens to be my business ! - Get lost ! - This is n't over . I 'm going to check it out . Do you want to join me ? - Yes . - Are you ready for that ? - Yes . - Okay , let 's keep on filming . Let 's find a new camera and continue . Here comes our new camerawoman . Malica . - Malica . - Thomas . You are not Christian . - You do n't believe in Jesus or God ? - I 'm a Muslim . Excellent . Muslim is okay , right ? I honestly do n't know . We 'll see what happens . - It must be okay . - We 're filming musk oxen , right ? No , not exactly . - Let 's go . - Yes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Where have you worked ? - Norwegian TV , BBC ... - I just filmed some lions in Tanzania . - Lions . Good . I 've never seen anything like this . Holy shit . They 've broken every single tree over several acres . I assume what has happened is that a Jotnar has run through here . A giant , over 200 feet tall , has chased the Dovre trolls down here . We do n't want Jotnars running around . Give me a break . Do you all actually believe in trolls ? You think a squirrel rampaged through here ? If only the trolls were happy . But TSS wants to keep a lid on everything . Those may look like normal power lines , but they 're electric fences to keep the trolls at bay . I do n't know how they broke through . I 'll have to check . Let 's go visit the clowns in charge of the power grid . - Do they know about the trolls ? - No way . Have you had any problems up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can hang your coats here . Over here . Several hundred meters of power line , knocked to the ground . 300,000 volts . - When did this happen ? - Three weeks ago . - Do you know how it happened ? - No . No one does . Those cables are supposed to withstand hurricanes . We have no clue . - Is this a school project ? - Yes . Volda College . - Are you a teacher ? - No . Where does that line go ? It runs from here ... then north , in a loop , and back to here . - So it runs in a circle ? - Yes , exactly . You do n't find that strange ? Maybe a little . - Yes , it is strange . - The power leads to nowhere . Well , it does lead in a circle . And in a beautiful landscape . If a Jotnar runs through a power line , something is seriously wrong . I 'd better get up there and try to find it . The territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pylons . Activists and farmers always complain . I think they 're pretty . Those were placed out here as food for trolls . This is the territory . We have been here . And here . And no sign of trolls . I think we should try this area next . There 's a TSS cabin up there where we can wait . Some scientists say it is caused by natural phenomena , while others more than 1000 quakes registered ... We are in a troll territory now . You do n't seem to like entering these territories . Is there some particular reason ? There was a mountain troll territory up in Strynefjell . Back in the ' 70s they decided to build tunnels through that troll-rich area . Both the TSS and I tried to object , but to no avail . I was given the task of going in and exterminating all the trolls . Every last one . Pregnant females . Kids . Newborns that had n't even learned to walk . It was a massacre . Hans ' entire life has revolved around trolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolls . In many ways , he is a superhero here in Norway . What would we have done without him ? That makes it all the more important for us to make this movie . My shoulder . Are you alright ? The sun will be up in an hour . Should we go too ? He sounds a bit big , but I 'll give it a shot . It sounds like he 's snapped completely . This could be problematic . Your phone is ringing , Hans . - Where is it ? - On my seat . Thomas speaking . He 's a little busy right now . Can I ... Rabies ? - That Ringlefinch had rabies . - Let me talk to Hilde . Hi Hilde . Are you sure ? That makes sense . Okay . You take care too . Bye . I 'll bet all the trolls we 've met had rabies . This guy has spread it to the Ringlefinches and Mountain Kings . - And even to you , Thomas . - Me ? I do n't have rabies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabies , you have to get to a hospital . If you think he has rabies , he needs medical attention ! I do n't have rabies . You ca n't just say I have rabies ! If so , we need a hospital now ! - That beast is on its way . Get inside ! - I could n't care less ! - We ca n't stay in here . - Look ! Is it coming this way ? Go outside ? Are you crazy ? He 's leaving ! Do n't move ! I 'll try to lure him this way . What a friend we have in Jesus ... What is he doing ? What 's happening ? The flash ran out of power . Definitely rabies . Can we go to the hospital now ? - No , he needs a few more doses . - What are you talking about ? But first I have to wear him out . He 's closing in on us ! - Now we 're getting away ! - Good . - There 's somebody up ahead ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurry , dammit ! Go ! Go ! - Where are you going ? - Stay here ! - Hans ! - Get back inside ! Oh my God ! Get back in the car ! - Who are you ? - A seismologist . I have to get in front of him . Look out ! Is it on ? Hans , what are you doing ? I have to give him the finishing blow ! - With that ? - Yes . I hope you have all the footage you need . This road will lead you to the highway . There 's no more roaring ! Malica ... Stop fooling around . That 's troll on tape . Here is the footage . Am I bleeding ? What did you say ? - Are you okay ? - Sure , I 'm fine . Look ! Over there ! Is n't that Finn and the others ? Shit , it 's Finn . Give me the camera ! Thomas , what are you doing ? The recordings end here . No body was ever found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trace . We strongly encourage anyone with information about their fate to contact Filmkameratene AS or your nearest police station . It has been impossible to get the Government to confirm the existence of the Troll Security Service . However , an indirect confirmation was given during Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg 's biannual press conference in Oslo on June 25 , 2010 . The press did n't get the point . We want to protect the Norwegian environment as best we can . Few people find power grids attractive . I certainly do n't . Norwegians are pro electricity , but against power lines .

Does it even matter ? Well , I asked him about it , and he said , \" I do n't know . That 's just how I was raised . \" - Well , that makes sense . - No , that 's not right . Wait . Whoa ! Whoa ! He does n't know any difference . It 's disgusting . Why were you looking for mouthwash at his apartment ? Oh , we just went right over that part , did n't we ?

If I had n't broken your stupid rules , where would I be today ? Probably someplace where the internet 's working . And how long have you and Lexi been married ? Eight years . But I thought you said ... but you met at the ... Sang on a Saturday , sexed on a Sunday , married on Monday . It 's true . Dude , look , when I met Lexi , I knew that she was the one and that it would be perfect together . And we did n't give a shit what our parents or sponsors ... Or anybody else had to say about it . We marched on down to city hall and we laid it to rest . That 's great . Congratulations . She seems like a great gal . Then we went to a T.G.I.F . Fridays , got wasted , Consummated in the bathroom . Yeah . There ... that ... that place is fun . How long have you and Hedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , we 're not married , uh , yet . We 're engaged . Oh , great , great , great . How long you been engaged ? Uh , six years . You 've been engaged for six years ? Yeah . Just ' cause two people get engaged ... Does n't mean they have to get married right away . - No , no . Of course ... - And there 's no need to succumb to pressures ... - Just ' cause society says you should . - Totally agree with ... I think that you should set the date when the time is right . You know , when both people are secure in their careers ... And can afford a nice home and , uh , you want to start a family . Yeah , and cars can fly . What was that ? Huh ? I think , uh ... I think Hedy 's getting pretty close to setting a date . Oh , yeah . Yes . Oh , you 're the one who 's ... oh .

You should just maybe change the channel . Maybe it 's just the one station . No , I really tried everything . Uh , did somebody forget to pay the cable bill this month ? It 's not that . We have the whole bundle , package thing . Internet , tv , land line . ( BEEPING ) Who still has a land line ? - It 's for faxing . - Who still faxes ? The guy who owns this tv still faxes . Got nothing here . That makes sense , yeah . ( @beeping_continues ) Are you fucking kidding me ? Huh . ( HANDSETSETTLESINCRADLE ) LEXI : We 're walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , and he 's , like , \" do you want some blow ? \" As if he had heard us talking about it inside ! Like an angel or something . No , I think they 're called drug dealers . ( LAUGHS ) So we gave him some dough , and he hooked us up with some primo shit . We hung out with the white lady till , like , 7:30 . Wait . When was this ? Last night . - Are you kidding ? - No . - Did you sleep ? - No . I 'll sleep when I 'm ... Well , you 're gon na sleep when you 're dead . How many times do we have to tell you how bad cocaine is for you ? All your little angels shot down . You 'd think I 'd stop telling my drug stories to doctors and chemistry teachers . Yeah , you 'd think , but you still do it . And if you want to sing , it 's gon na fuck up your whole nasal cavity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you talking about ? - You knew you were moving out so you did n't pay the bills . - What ? - What ? I paid the bills like I pay them every month ... Because you 're too lazy to do it . Well , then why is our internet , cable and land line out ? - Who has a land line ? - It 's for faxing . Emma , why are you moving out ? Do you honestly think that I am so childish that , what , I would purposely sabotage your new bachelor pad ? Yeah . I think you 'd think it 's hilarious . I bet you did n't pay the electric bill because you thought it would be funny ... If I bumped into shit in the dark . I paid the goddamn electric bill . ( SIRENSWAILINGINDISTANCE ) ( CHUCKLES ) - I had nothing to do with this . - Of course not . Hey , bro , I think your power 's out . Yeah , you fucking think ? - Whoa , whoa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't waste your time , man . It 's not worth it . Emma , why are you moving out ? Whoa , wait . Emma 's moving out ? That 's what she said . Why ? - Well , ask her . - Why ? - I never said I was moving out . - I did . So you 're moving out ? No , I said that Emma 's moving out . ( TOGETHER ) Why ? Because we 're getting a divorce ! ( SIRENSWAILINGINDISTANCE ) I thought you wanted to wait until the end of brunch . Well , I guess someone let the cat out of the fucking bag ... When he revealed I was moving out . So you really did n't pay the electric bill ? No , I paid the fucking bill ! You guys know the power 's out , right ? Yes ! ( TOGETHER ) We know ! Did I miss something ? Pete and Emma are getting a divorce . Really ? Why ? Okay . You know what ? This is not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to wait until the end of brunch to tell you , But we 've just decided that it 's what 's right . That 's really vague . EMMA : Well , it 's complicated , Lexi . Marriage is complicated . You know that . So it 's a mutual thing . PETE : Yeah . It 's not like one of us caught the other one cheating or anything . This is n't happening . No , you 're not getting a divorce . No , you 'll still see us , okay ? Just not together . Well , you know , maybe physically together , but not together together . But what we do n't want is people picking sides . We really want to remain close friends with all of you . Yeah . Unless some of you feel very strongly about one of us over the other . Tracy , for instance , If you want to stay in touch with Emma and completely shut me out of your life , - I 'd understand . - No , Pete , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't need to make a decision now . So does this mean brunch is over ? Do you want us to leave ? Shane , they just told us they 're getting a divorce , - And you 're still thinking about Alpha Force ? - Alpha flight . I honestly did n't know if they wanted us to leave , Because I have a feeling it 's about to get a little uncomfortable . Oh , do you have that feeling ? Which is exactly why I wanted to wait until after we ate to bring this up . ( SIGHS ) You know what ? He 's right . It is about to get uncomfortable . But I 'll be the one who 's leaving . ( MOUTHINGWORDS , SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) ( WATERGURGLING ) Oh , hey , I think the power 's out . Shut the fuck up , glenn ! I am so sorry . I did n't mean that . I 'm under a lot of stress right now , and I 'm taking it out on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh ! Oh , did you suddenly want to talk in private now ? Emma , come on . You ca n't leave . How many times are we gon na have this conversation ? No , right now . You ca n't leave right now . ( @sirens_wailing ) This is the last time we 're all gon na be together like this . ( @sirens_blaring ) The last of our famous couples brunches . Have you ever , in the last eight years ... No . You know what ? Let 's go farther back when we were dating . So let 's say 12 years . Have you ever in the last 12 years ... Truly looked forward to one of these couples brunches ? ( @sirens_wailing , BLARING ) Well , what do you mean \" looked forward to \" ? Look , Emma , you did n't even pack any socks . Well , I 'll buy more . Where are you gon na go ? It does n't matter . Maybe , uh ... no , she 's not supposed ... that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or toothpaste . I 'll get them at the same store where socks are sold . Emmers , wait ! Do n't call me that ! Um , enjoy my quiche . ( SIRENSWAILINGINDISTANCE ) ( SCREAMS ) What ? Um , there 's a ... there 's a man ... - A man ? - He 's wearing a hazmat suit . ( KNOCKING ) It 's Hal . - What ? SHANE : - Who 's Hal ? - He 's our neighbor . - Does he always wear a hazmat suit ? What does Hal want ? EMMA : I do n't know . Is there a reason to be afraid of hal ? No , he 's nice . I mean , he does n't mow his lawn enough , but I do n't ... Can I suggest that maybe we let him in ... And then we can find out what he wants , from his mouth . ( KNOCKING ) ( @door_closes ) Pete . Hey , hal . Emma . Hey , hal . You guys having a party ? Just brunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my invite . It 's a couples thing . Oh . Oh , okay . So I invite you guys to all my game nights , My barbecues , but since linda left me , I guess I do n't even socialize anymore . No , hal , we did n't ... no , we never intended to ... I mean ... Hal . Hal , why are you wearing a hazmat suit ? Are you kidding ? You really do n't know you 're wearing a hazmat suit ? - You guys have n't heard ? - Heard what ? That a bunch of dirty bombs were set off downtown . Uh , what 's a dirty bomb , bro ? It 's a radiological weapon . It combines radioactive material and conventional explosives . I 'm sorry . Is this like ... are you joking ? No . I was watching the U.T . Game , and the news cut in . You guys did n't notice that the power and the cell phones and land lines all went out ? You just thought you forgot to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the blast radius ? Five or six . It was right downtown . Oh , my god . It took out half the financial district . - Most of Messenier Park . - Oh , I love that park . God , I hope the taffy guy is okay . That 's like ... that 's like 12 miles away . If five or six ... yeah . Then the national news cut in . They said there were attacks on los angeles , new york , orlando . And they were about to say more , but the tv cut out . Orlando ? Someone thinks orlando is on par with new york and los angeles ? Did they say who did set them off ? Were there any ships or ... - Ships ? - You know , were the attackers not of this earth ? Anyway , the radiation cloud is probably coming . So I would recommend that you guys probably tape up your windows , Close the air vents , put on your hazmat suits . Who the fuck has a hazmat suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we 're supposed to stay inside , then what are you doing here ? Batteries in my emergency flashlight died , so I was gon na see if you had any extras . What kind of batteries ? ( CHUCKLES ) I do n't ... what do you even use \" d \" batteries for ?

It 's invasion 101 . You cut off all lines of communication to keep the locals confused . Radio ! If this is for real , it 'll be all over the radio . What about the one my mom got us for christmas ? - No . I sold that at a garage sale . - What ? Why ? Because we already have a clock by the bed , and that one was really ugly . - When did we have a garage sale ? - I had one when you were in singapore for your convention . - You had a garage sale when I was out of town ? - I did ! You keep everything ! Another radio ? Guys , do you have another radio ? Is there another radio besides that one ? How about some of us look for a radio ...

They were n't always brilliant . I 'm still working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the hell ? Are you nuts ? Man : What a treat ! What a treat ? Come backstage . I 'll show you a real one . ( laughter ) Jerry Seinfeld : I think if you do n't get Jerry Lewis , you do n't really understand comedy , because he is the essence of it . ( orchestraplayingjazz ) He is essentially it . He is the diamond of comedy . The stuff that looks like it 's just slapstick and just happening , that 's ' cause he 's a genius and he can make it look like that . You ca n't reach as many people for such a long period of time unless it 's thought out . All guys , you know , who loved funny , were touched by him . ( @blows_raspberry ) Oh ! There 's only one Jerry Lewis . - ( snoring ) - Look at all of the laughter that he has given to people . I really love Jerry and owe him so much . He 's just been a real , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in my career . He is the last great giant of the great days of the business . He bridges the old Hollywood and now . ## Mam ? e , mam ? e , mam ? e , eu quero ## ## Mam ? e , eu quero mamar ## ## Mam ? e , eu quero ... ## - ( recordingslowsdown ) - ## Mamar . ## He was the most gifted , intuitive person ever . It 's astonishing , you know . He spoke this language that even probably wildlife would laugh at . ( whistles ) I do n't ever remember a time before Elvis . I do n't remember a time before Jerry Lewis . He was always part of my consciousness at the youngest age that I can think of . Everybody 's like him in the morning when they get up and look in the mirror and start making faces . Everyone 's like him when they want to try to be funny . We 're all like that . It 's just that he was the best , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like Jerry Lewis , I have no interest in hanging with you . We ca n't even have a relationship . Jerry Lewis was in this magic position of being a monster box office star . And he could do what he wanted . And he did n't play it safe . He has been some extraordinary things , amazing things . ( laughsloudly ) He makes movie after movie after movie that ... people go crazy for this thing he 's doing . It 's almost like before Jerry , after Jerry . He 's like the Beatles of movie comedy . ( jazzcontinuesplaying ) ( reportersclamoring ) - Woman : How do you do ? - Lewis : How do you do ? - Are you French ? - Oui . Good . Then you belong here . Can you say in French , \" Bonjour , les petits gens \" ? Oh , bonjour , bonjour . Bonjour . Fini . Woody Harrelson : A lot of people , by the time they hit their 70s , you know , they 're pretty much , \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \" He just keeps charging . I love that about him . Lewis : I have a message for your editor . I just got off the plane and I open up the newspaper and there 's this picture of Brad Pitt . I do n't want any of those small little pictures . And then I want to go see Brad Pitt at the hotel and tell him he 's finished . It 's amazing how much energy and creativity he still has . The fact that he 's still doing it is pretty cool . Woman : Are you going on the red carpet tonight ? Lewis : Yeah . I 'm going to put on a tuxedo . - It 'd better be a good film . - ( laughter ) I hope it 's dirty . ( laughter ) Jerry Lewis : France is always given the credit for discovering Jerry Lewis . But in terms of fan following , Italy is first , Germany is second , the Netherlands is third , Japan is fourth , Australia is fifth and France is sixth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount that we got 15-18 years ago . Announcer : Monsieur Jerry Lewis est avec nous ce soir . Lewis : We 're excited about our film . And we came to Cannes because we knew there were films like \" Suck My Blood \" ... - ( laughter ) ... \" I Was a Teenage Lesbian , \" \" After the Circumcision , Lick lt . \" Crowd : Please . Please . Jerry . Merci beaucoup . ( @cheering_and_applause ) Although my films to this day make a lot of money all over the world , I 've never received critical and loving affection like I do from the French . ( narrating ) When I played Paris , I was onstage and I knew that there were 13,000 to 15,000 people lined up to try to get tickets for the day after . It went on like that for 30 days . At the end of one show they brought me affectionate gifts : Flowers , wine , cheese , ham , cookies , candy . The stage was engulfed . I would love to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do is say , \" I 'm going to do it again , \" that 's all . The story of an older man is not ordinarily why you would make a film . But since everyone I know grew up with me ... ( womantranslating ) ... I want them to get old with me . And you know what 's so wonderful ? To see the signs and the billboards and the ads ... \" Jerry Lewis Live ! \" Beats the hell out of the alternative , I 'll tell you that . We do two things all over the world . We throw away the garbage and we throw away the old people . ( womantranslating ) And I think the old people have a life , - they have ... - ( womantranslating ) ( laughter ) They have no interpreters . I 'm not so sure Jerry Lewis ever has quit . He 's just too important . Lewis : I think that I recognized that I 'm strictly a professional entertainer and my concern is getting them entertained . Chris Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life . ( JerryLewislaughs ) Making people laugh is what made him feel accepted . You know , from not having his parents because they were traveling in vaudeville all the time and being raised by his grandmother , the acceptance that he got from people around him was by making them laugh . Jerry Lewis : I did a show when I did Sahara and my dad comes backstage . And it was one of those shows that was so electric . I did about two hours and 20 minutes . And I said , \" Dad , what about tonight ? \" He said , \" Do n't worry , you can make it better tomorrow . \" I said , \" What the hell are you talking about ? It 's the best show I ever did in my life . \" He said , \" With one exception : You turned your back on your audience to get a laugh from your band . That 's not professional . \" There was no way to go with it . I had to just hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you notice ? That 's right . You 're telling me . ( laughs ) Okay . ( mocklaugh ) ## When there are grey skies ... ## What ? Do n't you mind in the least . My dad played in burlesque getting 50 bucks a week as the singer , straight man and MC at burlesque shows . My mom was his conductor . She was an incredible musician . He and she would play on a Saturday night , four hotels in the borscht circuit . ( DannysinginginYiddish ) So the owner said to my dad , \" If you let the kid go on , we 'll give you 10 more . \" So the following Saturday my mom had a tux made for me . How do you not clap for a five-year-old in a tux ? ( chuckles ) As a kid , I ca n't see it working ... a little five-year-old going , \" Hey , lady ! \" They 'd be like , \" Hey . What 's wrong with that child ? \" He had to kind of grow into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the song , he knew what he was doing . Now I sang a Depression song . ## Once in khaki boots ## ## Gee , we looked swell ## ## Full of that Yankee deedlee dum ## ## Half a million boots ## ## Slogging through hell ## ## And I was the kid with the drum ## ## Hey , do n't you remember ## ## I 'm your pal ## ## Buddy , can you spare ## ## A dime ? ## And people went ballistic . And I take the bow . My foot slips , breaks the bulb , explodes and makes this huge noise . And I jump three inches off the stage into my father 's arms . And I heard ... this laugh was incredible . It was the first audience I ever heard laughing at something I did . And it was good . I thought to myself , \" God , is that my life ? I 'm gon na be a bulb-breaker ? \" ( laughs ) A bulb-breaker . ## God bless me ... ## ( laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snickers ) ## When I ... ## I was already telling my dad , \" I know what I want to do in this life , and that 's just perform like you . \" ## Promise you wo n't stray ... ## Jerry Lewis : Everything that was on that stage was for the betterment of his performance . You 're a fancy singer , boy . Jerry Lewis : I never saw such a selfless man . He went out there to give them pleasure . ## Sonny boy . ## I was like the kid that knows he 's gon na play baseball and has to spend four weeks at Babe Ruth 's house . He was part of the last wonderful vaudeville people that taught all of us in motion pictures what to do . In order for comedy to work there must be a pace , a tempo . Without a tempo , you have no joke . Without a tempo , you have no visual and you lose the spirit of comedy . - ( fastmusicplaying ) - ( typewriterkeysclicking ) Seinfeld : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep repeating it . He changes it like a musical variation , but his instinct telling him , \" Time to change it , \" you know , and makes the second half of the bit just as funny . ( @music_playing ) ( **28;2381;TOOLONG ) ( musicfinishes ) ( @cheering_and_applause ) Carol Burnett : He 's a very gifted genius . ( laughs ) The typewriter ... whew . I could have that on a loop and just watch it all the time . It 's just brilliant . Someone get the stool for me , eh ? The stool up ... the individual ... ( @laughter_and_applause ) Thank you . I went on the road at 16 . I went to Buffalo , played the Buffalo Palace Burlesque Theater that my dad had played 20 years before . They put me on in front of the front curtain after a sketch messed up the stage . They had to get the stage clear for the stripper . Of course I did n't need music . I did a dumb act . - ( tenorsinging ) - Put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my salary . I did \" The Barber of Seville \" with a grey fright wig . I did Frank Sinatra , \" All Or Nothing At All \" ... yeah , mime , mimic . They did n't hear me say a word . You learned a lot doing five shows a day every day . Vaudeville was a great stepping-stone . ( @doorbell_rings ) Billy Crystal : He 's a crossover from vaudeville and burlesque . It 's like when silent films ended , there was this long reach till talkie comics really hit . And he feels like he 's straddling that . Close them together . Close ? Oh , all right . Crystal : There 's classic clowning in him and there 's this insanity . ( sighs ) They scooted ... Jerry Lewis : If you look at a scene I did in \" The Patsy , \" I rehearsed catching the vases for three weeks . And I think we went through 300 or 400 of them . I just kept getting prop department to make some more . I worked my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to get a shot at finding out what you think about things . And it 's amazing what comes up during the course of a QA session . So let 's try it . In 1972 I was in Memphis , Tennessee , and I met the king of rock ' n ' roll Elvis Presley . Mm-hmm . Now tonight I meet the king of comedy - Jerry Lewis . - ( @cheering_and_applause ) Jerry Lewis : Thank you . Thank you . Elvis is not dead . And neither am I . Ha-ha ! Wow , you know , people ask him things because he 's been around for 500 years . So it 's like , you know , \" Moses , when you ... you know , that 27th year in the desert when you built the thing ... \" \" Oh , yeah , the matzo factory . Well ... \" You know , it 's like ... he 's like ... he 's this biblical character . Hi . I would shake hands with you , but I see you 're busy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It was wonderful , just one right after another . I had a dream about you , about ... - ( microphonethuds ) - ( laughter ) Jerry is sexy , very charming . I find him very nice-looking when he 's not doing , \" Hey , lady , \" you know . But I 've always thought Jerry was sexy . So I understand why people would ... do they throw underwear at him ? I wanted to ask you if you think I have a problem , because I 'm only attracted to men with thick , black , dark hair because of you . ( laughter ) What about 6 ' 2 \" , 320-pound , I mean , huge men with blond hair ? I 'm only attracted to men with thick , dark , black hair like you . Have you been to South Africa ? ( laughter ) It 's side-splittingly , crazy funny . And it 's just him . It 's just him being Jerry . What 's better than that ? Jerry Lewis : They know that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do 30 minutes of that . It 's totally spontaneous . It 's unscripted . It 's unrehearsed . It really brings out , I think , the genius of his comedy , because not everybody can do that . I have a gentleman over there . Yes , sir . Jerry , I worship you . I think you 're the greatest . But I needed to say ... I wanted to ask you if you think I have a problem . I am only attracted to men with thick , dark , black hair ... ( laughter ) ... because of you , Jerry . ( @cheering_and_applause ) Bravo . ( manlaughs ) Thank you . I prayed my whole life for stardom and two things that comes with it . You walk in every kitchen of every hotel in America ... that 's stardom ... if you want to get to your dressing room . And the other one is YouTube ... half of my act is on it . - Man : Which half ? - The one I did with my partner . So here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ## ( fanfare ) Jerry Lewis : That was July of ' 46 . You do n't often lay back and think back that far . I do on occasion , but it 's a long , long time . ( @breaths_deeply ) Lewis and Martin : ## What would I do without you ? ## ## What would I do , boy ? ## ## What would I do without you ? What would I do ? ## Martin : ## I need a partner , you 're the one ## Lewis : ## I 'll be right there when the show goes on ## - ## I 'm for you ## - ## I 'm for you ## Together : ## From California to Kalamazoo ## ## What would I do without you when you 're gone ? ## ## When you 're gone , when you 're gone ## ## Oh , what would I do without you ? What would I do ? ## Jerry Lewis : Standing up on that stage , I knew it instantly we were on our way to the galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the second night . Then he came to me and he said , \" I think I know what you 're talking about . \" I said , \" How ? \" He said , \" Well , I feel like I 'm walking more upright . \" I said , \" You got it . You got it . \" ## We ' Marie ... ## ( playspianochords ) ( laughter ) Carl Reiner : My first recollection of Jerry is very , very clear . It was 1947 , Boston . I hate to use the word \" blown away , \" but I was . And I never use that word until today . \" Blown away \" is a terrible phrase . I was so impressed . First of all , it was a totally ad lib thing . They had no act . And that 's what made it brilliant . - ( continuesplayingchords ) - ( audiencelaughter ) It was this guy interrupting his friend from singing ... that 's the whole thing . His friend started to sing and he just kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what song we were singing . ( laughing ) Come here ! It was mayhem , but hysterical mayhem . People were on the floor . That went all right , crazy ? I 've never seen anything as funny in my life as that particular act , never forgot it . And of course the rest is history . Everybody felt the same way about Jerry and Dean . It was a revelatory act . Everybody who saw it became fans . There was no doubt they were gon na make it . There was no doubt . ## We ' Marie ## ## We love you all . ## Jerry Lewis : We had a deep respect for one another 's ability . I knew that Dean had the goddamnedest sense of instinct that I had ever seen in anyone . ( Britishaccent ) Oh , Judy , Judy , Judy , you ca n't take a baby out of a man 's life and expect him to go home ... ( applause ) Well , it 's not right and it 's not fair . Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry 's impression of the ex-prime minister of England . Ladies and gentlemen , Winston Churchill . ( **27;2411;TOOLONG ) ( highnasalvoice ) Thanks very much . Jerry Lewis : My partner said to Winston Churchill , \" Do you have to smoke that much ? \" I thought I 'd have a heart attack . It was his humor . What did he say ? And Churchill looked at him and he said , \" I really enjoy it . \" And I ran out of there . He had this incredible sense of , \" Now 's the time to do it . \" You and me , you and me . Ventriloquists , you and me . Oh , no , no . We sing and we dance . We 're a team . He wants a ventriloquist . That 's a guy , and he uses ... oh , no ! Jerry Lewis : My instinct topping his ... it was an incredible combination . What 's all this noise ? ( audiencelaughter ) Jerry Lewis : I needing a father figure because I was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He needed that more than anything . It was a love affair . It was the big brother . And Dean and Jerry 's dad kind of look similar . Martin : Wait , I do n't like the way you two guys are working together . It 's too good . And \" Sonny Boy \" ... I used to do it with you . - No , we 'll do it together again . - Can you hold it down , Danny ? You see what you 're starting , Dad ? You 're starting a whole argument . Dean , listen , do n't worry about nothing . So I think there was also a paternal transference there too . H-hello . I-I 'm Jerry Lewis , the new busboy . I 'm Dean Martin , the old waiter . Oh . It 's a small world , ai n't it ? It 's a little too small . Let 's get out of here . All right . Jerry Lewis : I think people were frightened over homosexual probabilities . They did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a man and a woman , a wife and a daughter , a son or husband . - Why do n't you take your clothes off ? - Here , I do n't even know you . Richard Belzer : They came along at a time right after World War II . No one was ever that anarchic ... - What 's the matter ? - Flood . ... and that physically attractive , that young , that dangerous . - Get off the stage ! - Look , I do n't mind in a room with the whips and the chains , but not in front of the audience . Get off the stage . It was the ' 50s . It 's a very ... you know , after the war , it 's a very conservative time . But what came about was this kind of anarchy . You know , you had rock ' n ' roll . You 're laughing . You forgot to take your watch off . ( laughter ) So Martin and Lewis are , I believe , part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anarchy . - You 're all mine ! ( laughing ) - You 're overactive , Jerry . The secret was , of course , that the audience was in on it . They were being naughty too . They redefined the nature of show business , which is pretty amazing when you ... you know , it 's pretty astounding stuff . Jerry Lewis : Very unbelievable ... the things that happened to us . In a matter of six months we went from making $450 a week ... we were getting $20,000 a week . People in our business ... their heads were turning all the time , \" What ? How much ? What ? What did they do ? I do n't know , but they 're hotter than we will ever be . And they 're getting all of the money there is in the world . \" And we 're reading in every paper and seeing on ever television program and hearing people talking about what we were doing and carrying on . We were very excited and very proud . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was fun . ( playingintro ) ## Just remember ... ## Crystal : When Jerry was onstage with Dean , something really special happened . They were amazing together . And it just looked like fun . Straight men are very rare . The great one's ... you can think of Carl Reiner with Mel , and Dean . He was different . He was charming . He was funny . He could act . He could seriously act . He was unselfish . He sang great . And they made each other great . Stand up . Take a bow . Do n't be shy . Hey ! Hey , lady ! Lady ! ( grunts , screams ) Richard Lewis : It 's like you were born and all of a sudden you 're watching a Martin and Lewis film . And it 's like I figured he was just part of the earth , you know , one of the essential things to know about . Crystal : They were the biggest stars in the world as a comedy team . When does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , six shows a day was unheard of . We love you all and we hope we can see you at the Paramount July 4th for two weeks . - Good night . God bless you all . - Good night . Goodbye . Jerry Lewis : We did two weeks , eight shows a day , 56 shows a week . We made $600,000 , ' cause we got 90% of the tickets and the theater got 10% . In order for me to get them out of the audience so that we could fill up the theater again , I would say , \" If you come backstage , we 're gon na have pictures for you . \" And as we left the stage , you saw 4000 people exit the theater . And they did that three or four times in a day , so you wind up with , like , 16,000 or 20,000 people out there . - ( crowdscreaming ) - And it was mass chaos all through Times Square right down to 9th Avenue . The mayor of the city came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him , \" Well , we could just close tonight . We could go away . \" He said , \" No , no , no , no , no . No , it 's good for the city . \" Eddie Murphy : When they blew up , it was very much like the Beatles or like Sinatra and Elvis . Thousands of people in the street ... looks like it 's New Year 's Eve , you know , and it 's just that they 're playing a gig in town . They 're the first big rock star . There was no rock star back then when they came out , but they had rock star popularity . Burnett : I was just starting high school when Jerry and Dean came along . It was explosive . And I 'd be the first in line to see one of their movies when it opened . Richard Lewis : You ca n't get bigger than this and for all the right reasons . He ripped people 's brains out . He ripped them to shreds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) We ai n't got any ! Jerry Lewis : The pandemonium that it caused was exactly what happened with the Beatles later on . It was incredible . Every once in a while I look on the stage to see where he would be . He 's not there anymore . So I think about the great times we had . He would walk in front of an audience and , before he sang a note , he would say to them , \" I want all of you people here tonight that do not drink , I want you to know that tomorrow when you get up , that 's as good as you 're gon na feel all day . \" ( laughter ) - Can I ask you a question ? - Yes . - Are you looking at me ? - Yes . - I 'm over here . - Oh , hello there , Jerry . You would n't mind breathing out that way once or twice , would you ? ( blowsair ) Jerry Lewis : I used to tease him over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting down or depressed ... \" Upright . \" \" Oh , yeah , okay . \" It worked . Chevy Chase : But I always wondered what happened after that breakup . Obviously Dean went on ' cause he had that great hair and was very , very funny and a , you know , great talent . July 25th ... I think a lot . That was the night we teamed up ... July 25th , 1946 . And we split July 25th , 1956 ... 10 years to the day . There 's no way to explain what I felt . And I said goodbye , and he said goodbye . Then the work goes on and on and on . Alec Baldwin : I guess it was just destiny that it was n't gon na last very long and that Lewis had to go off and do his own thing . Not that he did n't need Martin , but there was just a whole other thing he needed to do . Deana Martin : They had their thing together . They had their time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something again , because it was just perfect the way it was . And then we can just admire them for who they became . Seinfeld : Jerry and Dean deciding to end when they were still legends , as opposed to when it was starting to fray ... I wanted that too for my Tv series . I wanted to make sure that I just went out before ... a moment before and not the moment after . Do you still think about Dean at night ? There is n't a day in my life that I do n't think of my partner , - not a day . - ( applause ) Never . I do n't have any qualms about proclaiming the love I had for my partner . Every time I walk on a stage , I know it 's because of him and what he did to get me there . It 's a constant appreciation and a gratitude to a man that I ca n't communicate with , but I just hope he is peeking and listening and knowing how much I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When you understand what it was that people saw and felt ... they saw a love affair between two men and they were coming out to make money doing it . And they were having a wonderful time . And audiences could n't believe the fun they were having . That was the mystery of it . Martin : Let 's do an old thing we used to do in the old act . All right , that 's fine with me . You 'll never have an ar ... you never , with me , an argument , at no time . - Never ? - Never . - Promise ? - Word . - Let 's have lunch someday . - Give me a ring . I 'm in the book . - All right . - All right . We sure created something . And we made it work and had a ball for 10 years , never to be duplicated by any couple of anything , ever .

And I did n't know at the time why I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na turn it into pay dirt . They said that ... what ? I turned down Metro , 20th , Universal , Sam Goldwyn , and went with Paramount . Well , I do n't care really about the hours or money . - Good . You 're hired . - Oh . When you 're that guy and you have that kind of career , everybody wants to work with you . - There 'll be lots of extras ... - Yeah . They 're sending you all the scripts and you 've got all the directors want to work with you and all the studios want to throw money at you . All the beautiful dames you 'll be with ... Oh , mwah . - Sharp cars ... - ( mimicsengine ) Well , Lewis is that perfect intersection of some great movie career where you 've got the goods and audiences love what you do and , you know , you just strike gold . - We pay all expenses . - Oh ! Jerry Lewis : Every time I created a film , I generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had hoped for it , and it was there every time . I stayed with Paramount for $800 million in ticket rentals . That 's when the movies were 25 cents apiece . Crystal : People who are not historians do n't realize how powerful he was at such a young age . Well , he was directing and starring and writing his own movies . And he was the biggest star in the world for years . Richard Lewis : He brought families together . The four-year-old would laugh . The 40-year-old would laugh . The grandfather would laugh . It 's hard to do that . It 's hard to do that . He did that . Jerry Lewis : Adolph Zukor used to call from New York to the West Coast office of Paramount and say , \" I 'm just calling to tell you to keep him warm . Keep him warm . \" Someone asked Barney Balaban how he gets along with Jerry Lewis . He said , \" Great . If he wants to burn down the studio , I 'll give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning and say , \" Dad gave me this studio . \" - ( @honks_horn ) - You know , I 'd drive in and start playing around . He did n't abuse the right to have the keys to the studio . He made real cutting-edge comedies . Jerry was truly an artist . I 'm DOA Bird , producer of fine films . That 's right . And if I may , I would like very much for some of you folk out there to meet some of the people that are to blame for ... I 'm sorry , I mean , that are responsible for this film . Someone gave me a hat with four beaks . This one was the director ... Shh , swine , ca n't you see I 'm creating ? Oh , it 's you , Mr . Bird . It 's a pleasure to have you on the set . ( clicksheels ) Oh , I broke both my ... - Producer ... - Oh , they 're all strange . - Writer ... - Hel ... hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , great producer . Actor . They wanted to talk to me ... they 'd switch the hat around . Here is our star ... the man who will deliver us from Tv and once again having the theaters bursting with laughter ... Jerry Lewis . ( snickers ) Quentin Tarantino : It always really is exciting when a performer feels compelled to move into filmmaking and go even further with their art . Jerry Lewis : My impression of your everyday , run-of-the-mill , basic , ordinary , simple drunk . ( scatteredlaughter ) The same drunk in an earthquake . ( @laughter_and_applause ) What a stupid way to make a fortune . ( @cheering_and_applause ) Announcer : Paramount Studios announces an unprecedented $10 million pact with Jerry Lewis . Such excitement over a piece of paper has not been experienced by the world since the League of Nations Covenant was rejected by the Congress of the United States of America . Chris Lewis : My dad did make a deal with Paramount . He signed a $10 million deal with Paramount in ' 59 . And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the rights would revert back to him , because they wanted him so badly . Crystal : Here came this big noise . What was that ? He had a different magnetism and a different energy than anyone onscreen had at that time . Jerry Lewis : \" Cinderfella \" was made for family . And I built the entire marketing campaign on that , because the film that I was doing was so special . I went to Rockwell and asked him if he would do it . I wanted the best . I have the only Rockwell ever commissioned to be the advertisement of a motion picture . Hey , mister , you got that all wrong . How ? You forgot the most important letter ... the F . Whoa . Whoa . His comedies , you know ... he was very specific about when they came out ... you know , a summer picture and then a Christmas picture . Jerry Lewis : And I would n't let the studio release the picture - until it was holiday time . - ( @crowd_gasps ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a Christmas release . \" - Man : But , chief ... - But nothing . You sell ' em and I 'll make ' em . Now for the Christmas campaign I 'm gon na make a real kids ' picture with big names . - Okay , chief . - And when you talk to New York , you tell them I said ... I 'll do anything they say . Jerry Lewis : And Paramount was at a point where if they did n't have a Jerry Lewis movie in the summer , they 're blowing a lot of money . So I said to Barney Balaban , \" I 'll give you a Jerry Lewis movie . \" I go to Florida and I wrote a 165-page screenplay in nine days . And I was shooting on the 14th day . Jerry , can we play that \" Bellboy \" theme ? - I 'm waiting to hear it . - A-one , two , three , four ... ( playing \" Bellboy \" theme ) Jerry wrote the theme from the \" Bellboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funny note at the top . ( humstheme ) - That 's what ... that 's ... - ( laughter ) Jerry Lewis : When I left New York to open at the Fontainebleau , I had this short amount of time . I had a clock by my typewriter that was noisy . ( imitatesclockticking ) And every tick I heard was getting me closer to , \" Jesus Christ , you big mouth , how did you get yourself into this ? \" ( laughs ) And I 'm reviewing what I 'm writing ... \" Oh , it 'll be okay . I 'll write some more . \" I finished the script before I finished my engagement . I was only there for two weeks . The motion picture you 're about to see is n't the run-of-the-mill film fare that has been presented to the moviegoing public of late . There is no story and no plot . It is a visual diary of a few weeks in the life of a real nut . Jerry Lewis : I went to Billy Wilder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read \" The Bellboy \" and he came back to me and he said , \" Goddamn wonderful . It 's wonderful . ( imitatesaccent ) I ca n't wait to see it on the screen . It 's terrific . \" I said , \" Well , I want you to direct it . \" He said , \" Are you crazy ? I would n't direct you . Are you nuts ? You do it . It 's your baby . You wrote it . Direct it . You 'll get what you want that way . \" I said , \" Okay . \" I had n't thought about that . But then I closed at the Fontainebleau , then I got it done in 48 days . I go and I open at the Sands in vegas ... another commitment that I had to honor . So I was cutting the picture down in the musicians ' room in the basement , at the Sands , and delivered it to Paramount ... - Hold it . ... in less than 20 weeks . - Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chief . Mm-hmm , and who 's the guy with the straw hat ? He 's the guy that tells you who we are . Jerry Lewis : I 'd never had such a good time . I was getting stronger in my convictions of what I was printing . I was getting stronger about my ability . I 've never seen you laugh so hard . I 've got Stanley on theater seating duty . Alone ? How long has he been in there ? I just sent him in . He 'll be in here for two , three days at least . - Let 's go and watch . - Okay . ( doorrattles ) ( whistling \" Bellboy \" theme ) He 's fast . Jerry Lewis : The night that I finished the first shoot day , I called my dad . He said , \" How did it go ? \" And I said , \" Dad , I ca n't believe I did the things I did n't know I knew and it worked . \" He said , \" Stay there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \" \" Okay . \" It was an extraordinary time . It 's like that one time in your lifetime that something like that 's gon na work or that you 're gon na even attempt it . There you are , Stanley . Get everything out of the trunk . And Paramount turned chicken when they read the screenplay . And they thought I was doing a silent movie . I said , \" It 's not a silent movie . A lot of noise in this movie . The kid just does n't talk . \" I said , \" You do n't have to go with me . Stay out of it ... \" ( @phone_ringing ) \" ... and I will produce the film . \" ( phonestopsringing ) \" But it will be my negative . \" \" Great . \" They were thrilled . - ( whistlingtune ) - ( @phone_ringing ) ( phonecontinuesringing ) ( phonestopsringing ) Jerry Lewis : $975,000 later ... - ( @phone_rings ) ... I cut negative . ( @phone_ringing ) - ( phonestopsringing ) - To date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . ( @phone_ringing ) - ( phonestopsringing ) - And they were not participating . Belzer : He wrote \" The Bellboy \" and paid for it himself and shot this masterpiece where he does n't speak until the last minute of the movie . How is it we never heard you talk before ? Because no one ever asked me . Jerry Lewis : Nobody believed I could pull it off in the first place . Nowadays if they hear the word \" Bellboy , \" they puke right in the hall , on the rug ... \" Bleh ! \" Because there 's no telling what it 's gon na continue to make for years on end . When you got a good negative , it 's forever . A woman goes to the doctor for an exam . A woman goes to the doctor for an exam . She comes home . She 's flitting around the house from room to room with an energy level unlike anything the husband had ever seen . He finally stops her . He says , \" Honey , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're so happy about ? \" She said , \" Sweetheart , you know what the doctor said to me today ? He said I had the breasts of an 18-year-old . \" He said , \" Really ? What did he say about your 45-year-old ass ? \" ( @laughter_and_applause ) She said , \" Your name never came up . \" ( @laughter_and_applause ) Oh ! Oh ! Listen to the women ... \" No ! \" Jerry refers to himself in different ways . He calls himself Jerry or \" the kid \" or \" the idiot , \" because he has to know which Jerry he 's playing in different scenes . And I had a similar thing on my show where I had ... was Jerry and Tv Jerry . Crystal : Directing yourself in your own movie that you 've written and you 've crafted a character for yourself is so hard . Man : 51-2 . Crystal : If you have a vision for something and he knows who he is , and it sometimes is hard for someone else to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Well , just do n't do something . Sit there . Uh , that is ... class dismissed ! Tarantino : And it was n't just , \" Let me do it because I 'm tired of listening to that hack , \" all right , or , \" Well , if that guy can do it , I can do it . \" You know , he did n't come from that place . He wanted his films to be terrific . And he wanted to be considered a serious director who did comedy . He is much closer to Buster Keaton than Charlie Chaplin , insofar as actually taking the film medium and trying to get laughs by the way you shot stuff , by the art form itself ... - ( whistlingatune ) ... not just the pratfalls , not just \" filming my comedy , \" but the comedy is also part of the filmmaking process itself . ( @camera_shutter_clicks ) ( @birds_chirping ) Steven Spielberg : He was a restless filmmaker , you know . He was always searching . He was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling a story , you know . He was trying to , I think , almost redefine the art of the narrative . The Marx Brothers , when they had the right writer and the right director and all the pieces were in place , they made great movies . Man : 490 , take 4 . ( knocks ) - Yes ? - ( laughs ) But Jerry made them himself . He did it all himself . So that 's a very different thing . I have always been so intrigued with what we are capable of doing technically . Richard Lewis : Jerry is a genius . He invented unbelievable things as a director that people use to this day . Every time a director takes a shot and then runs over and looks at it , it 's Jerry . Oh ! Jerry Lewis : I had nightmares thinking how much I 've learned in the picture industry , and what do I do if I want to direct Jerry ? ( mumbles ) I do n't know that . Jerry Lewis : What do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera operator ? Suffuse his sense of humor to the way that it must be , to print or dump ? What do I do ? I decided that if I was gon na direct Jerry , the only time I would ever print would be if I saw what he did . In the picture business we have wires that usually hold . - ( womangiggling ) - Unfortunately this goddamn thing broke . Cut . He is the performer . Jerry 's not only writing , producing , directing , God knows , painting the sets , whatever the hell he 's doing , you know . You understand why he created video assist ... because he 's the performer . What about if you had a video camera alongside your B and C and you keep your monitor where you can see it ? Because there was n't tape then . Murphy : Video playback changed all of filmmaking . This guy said , \" Hey , wait a minute . Let me see right on the set what we just shot . \" I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the monitor and go , \" Can I get another one ? Can we do one more ? \" Jerry Lewis : I go to Tokyo and I sat with Mr . Morita ... the chairman of the board of the Sony Corporation , with his research people . And they 're all drawing me sketches . Shipped everything back from Tokyo with me and I called the crew and we set up everything . It was magic . Spielberg : The video assist was invented by Jerry because nobody had any idea what they were getting until the operator blessed it or until the operator critiqued it . Jerry Lewis : So it became a great tool for my wardrobe , makeup , grips , electricians . The camera operator loved seeing what he had just finished setting up . Spielberg : The camera operator was in collaboration for the first time with the filmmaker , with the director himself . And now the operator and the director could figure out how to tweak the shot , make it better . That 's genius . But it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ... ' cause he could see it right there . I directed Jerry Lewis in \" Mr . Saturday Night . \" He came on the set . He saw the video assist . He told me , \" I invented that . \" I said , \" But you did n't have playback . You just could watch . \" And he went , \" Details , details . \" Jerry Lewis : And then a year later I get video tape . Spielberg : There should be a sign , you know , saying ... ( laughing ) \" Jerry Lewis invented this . \" Jerry Lewis : I learned from Joe Mankiewicz ... \" You will be a great director the day you understand you have to create an atmosphere of fun . You will get people skipping to work in the morning . \" - ## I love you , I love you . ## - ( laughing ) ## You 're Jewish and I 'm gay . ## ( crewlaughing ) One picture of the family . Hold it . - ( laughinglouder ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anything on was open to the public . The sign on the huge doors was , \" This is not a closed set . Please come in . \" Belzer : The fact that it says \" Open \" shows how fearless , how gracious ... \" This is what I do . Come and look at it . I 'm proud of it . \" - Jerry Lewis : I 'm going to work . - Man : All right , places , please . Jerry Lewis : All right , let 's hear it for the movie star . - Jerry Lewis : Hey , stupid ! - Crew : Hey ! My name is on the screen . I get the credit for all . But everyone on my crew was a teacher in one way or another . I 've worked very hard to let them always remember that I could n't do any of the stuff I did without them . Burnett : He was a guest star on my show . He knew everybody 's name on our crew . Once he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Morty . - Hello , Mr . Habanaffen . May I help you ? A lot of people have difficulty with that . - It 's Wo ... - Wo ben ... ... ben lot ... ... lot ny . ... ny . - Wobenlotny . - Babanotten . John Landis : I did a series of commercials for Coca-Cola with Jerry Lewis in the early ' 90s . He shows up , 8:00 in the morning , and he was introduced to every single individual there . Had to be 70 people . And then we shot . At the end of the day he wanted everyone 's attention . And everyone looks and he says , \" Listen , I 'd like to say good night , Bob , good night , Larry , good night , Gloria , good night , Shirley , good night ... \" Every single person 's name ... he knew their names . And so he went out in this blaze of glory and everybody was like , \" Wow ! \" I got two sets of bleachers on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved it . They were as big a ham as I am . They had fun watching me as the director . - ( playsachord ) - ( singsoff-key , laughing ) Then they had fun watching me as the comic . ( laughing ) Cut . They 'd see me run into myself . - ( laughing ) - Cut . It 's a challenge , when you 're feeling all of this power that you have to have and delegate to the right people , to keep yourself calm to give a performance . Woody Harrelson : The camaraderie had to be important for him just to be able to feel like he could just let go and do some of that wild insanity that he would ... he 'd come up with just the most ... ( truckhornblows ) Argh ! You have to feel safe to be able to do that . ( crewlaughing ) Son of a bitch . Will you leave me alone ? It just seemed like the most fun you could have ... in the ' 60s at Paramount , doing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read in the paper that a motion picture advertiser needed help . ( sighs ) - Do you have to go to the toilet ? - ( crewsnickering ) - No . - No ? - I 'm just fine . - ( laughter ) All right , cut . I have to tell you this because I ca n't keep it to myself any longer . I was in New York three weeks ago , could n't get a cab . It was raining . So I go downstairs to the subway and I get on the train . I 'm sitting there and it makes one stop . And this guy gets on wearing leather pants , leather jacket , leather shirt , leather tie , leather boots . And he had rings on his ears , on his nose , on his lip . And he had his hair swiped up yellow , red , green , purple . And he sits down right opposite me . And I 'm staring at him . He says , \" What 's the matter , old man ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , \" Yeah , about 20 years ago I had sex with a parrot . I thought you were my son . \" ( @laughter_and_applause ) This is just another thing of his amazing eye . ( explosion ) Man : Get the door ! ( @door_squeaks ) Seinfeld : When he gets called into the dean 's office as Professor Kelp after the explosion and he sits down in that chair and sinks into it ... to have the eye to know , \" This will look funny . \" He 's not doing anything . He 's just sinking in a chair . It 's brilliant . It 's so funny . It 's so simple . When I first started watching it , I just know , \" This guy is making me laugh every time I see him . \" And now , having done a few things myself , I understand a lot more and I appreciate the incredible richness of his skills even more . Look at the headline of the column . - Are you in focus ? - Man : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff to be in focus . ( laughing ) The thrill of getting an idea and then sketching it and then sitting behind a camera , and you 're looking and you see it 's exact , let 's shoot it ... it 's a rush . You want to do it some more . ( jazzorchestraplaying ) I wanted to see the kid - in a boardinghouse . - ( knocks ) Well , when you start with an idea like this , it just blooms . So I built this set . And it cost me almost a half a million to build it . We 're talking about 1960 . All my sound ... everything was in the ceilings . - Man : Let 's try to get a microphone ... - One , two , three , four ... Jerry Lewis : I had three mixers on the set to cover the 42 rooms . Spielberg : Those humongous sets on \" Ladies ' Man , \" in a sense , rivaling \" The Diary of Anne Frank \" set and \" The Rear Window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there . It was all there for a filmmaker to make choices . Just pull back ... you had it all right before your lens . They asked me if I would want to teach a class at USC . And I thought that sounded terrific . And I went for it . And I had eight magnificent years teaching post-grad students . He believed in young people . And he believed in a whole new generation of filmmakers coming up . And he had a class . For young filmmakers . And I had made \" Amblin \" ' ... my short film . And he invited me to show the film to the class and to speak about my process . In my case , being a fan of Jerry 's , almost feeling like pinching myself ... I ca n't believe I 'm in the same room and Jerry Lewis is actually having a conversation with me . Jerry Lewis : Spielberg was in that class . - Bogdanovich . - Bogdanovich was in the class , Randy Kleiser . He was warm . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he taught at USC and we were in his class , he recorded those classes , which ultimately became the book \" The Total Film-Maker . \" Jerry Lewis : Marty Scorsese never went on the set without the book . I would argue with him about something , he said , \" Hold on a second . \" So he 'd lean over and he 'd turn pages in my book . Spielberg : And he loved those kids . I mentor now to this day . Jerry Lewis taught me the importance of mentoring . Harrelson : The main reason I 'm a performer is because of Jerry . He speaks to the common man . All I wanted to do is apologize to you , see ? Will you get out of here ? If you do n't , I 'm gon na ... - Argh ! - Oh , wait , my foot . - My foot is stuck . - Get out of here . Harrelson : You love him . You root for him ... the , \" Oh , no , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidscreams ) - ( @woman_screams ) Here , let me cover you up . ( babbling ) ( @woman_screaming ) Get me out of here ! ( orchestraplayingjazz ) - ( orchestrastops ) - ( laughter ) I dug the ' 60s comic books when I was a kid . I thought they were great . His comic books rocked . His comic books were made better than Bob Hope 's . I just got ta say that . I know it 's controversial . ( laughter ) But Jerry did the better comic than Bob Hope . Jerry Lewis : Oh , Jesus . - ( Tarantinolaughing ) He just spit on the American flag . Tarantino : Well , I remember one of Truffaut 's quotes : Jerry Lewis is almost like a whole year 's worth of cartoons in one performance . Jerry 's comedy existed in the world where cartoons already existed . Jerry Lewis is kind of like a cartoon figure . ( @laughter_and_applause ) ( cheering ) He was a kid . I mean , I loved the cartoon gags . Whoa ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( roars ) My God , that 's just what I did all the time as a kid ... you know , making faces . There was nobody better at it than him . ( giggling ) ( @cheering_and_applause ) Jerry went back to the silent era and he brought visual sight gags back to American movie theaters . They were n't doing that for a long time . Long before the Zuckers did \" Airplane ! \" Which I think owes a lot to Jerry Lewis movies , and before those great visual comedies ... you know , like all the Leslie Nielsen comedies . You have to look at Jerry . He 's kind of the father of that style of gags . Oh ! ( @cheering_and_applause ) I 've always thought that there was a connection between Jerry Lewis and Bugs Bunny a little bit , but one of the biggest connections is , when Bugs Bunny would get dressed up as a woman , well , that 's pretty much like when Jerry Lewis got dressed up as Carmen Miranda , all right ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is they actually go for sex appeal . He looks like a girl . Tarantino : \" Looney Tunes \" would constantly break the fourth wall and talk to somebody in the theater ... \" Hey , you in the third row , shut up . \" Over here . Let 's not fool with the child star . Tarantino : The end of \" Patsy \" when he falls ... - Whoa ! - Stanley ! Tarantino : It 's a perfect example of a \" Looney Tunes , \" break the fourth wall ... this is what we 're watching , in fact , and why are you watching it ? ( laughs ) Stanley . Are n't you overacting a little bit , Miss Balin ? Balin . It 's a movie , see ? I 'm fine . The people in the theater know I ai n't gon na die . Here , it 's a movie stage . Here , look at this , see ? There 's wires and lights . And I 'm gon na make more movies , so I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dumb city . Tarantino : That 's still kind of a bizarre joke today . It 's out there . You are a complete nut . Which reminds me , I 'm having nuts and whipped cream for lunch . Would you join me , please ? Crew , that 's lunch . One hour for the actors and seven days for the technicians . It 's a movie set breaking once and for all ... ( wheezing , mutters ) Jerry Lewis : There 's a lot of resilience in a director . He can take a lot of crap . It 's too heavy . You 'd better cut it , Lenny . ( crewlaughing ) Jerry Lewis : What he has to exude for the actors is solid confidence that he knows the way you 're gon na cut it , and the director is gon na tell you . When you make a set-up , know where it 's coming from , to there , and where that 's going , to there . The captain of the National Airlines jet just flew in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plane . - Now get down there and get it . - ( @tires_screech ) Jerry Lewis : In \" The Bellboy , \" when I had him drive to the airport , go into the airport , walk up the steps , he 's looking for the captain 's briefcase ... did n't have to say anything ; did n't have to do anything ; music was n't even important . Oh , Stanley ? Yes , he works for me . He what ? ( @engine_roaring ) The fact that it was on the cut : \" He what ? \" Bang ! He 's up there at 7,000 feet . I recut it 13 times , always coming back to the original thought ... chick-choo , chick-choo , chick-choo . You take a beat between \" chick \" ... you ca n't do that . Man : Would you say something into the microphone for me ? - Jerry Lewis : Now ? - Okay . ( loudly ) How 's it going ? Geronimo ! Jerry Lewis : The creative mind needs sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as vitally important as the picture . ( footstepssqueaking ) ( footstepssqueaking ) ( @school_bell_rings ) Jerry Lewis : He comes in . We see that he 's just blotto . It 's the hangover of the century . I used the slam of a safe door . ( loudbong ) Oh . Jerry Lewis : And I went to the Bank of America to shoot it . And we recorded the ... bo-o-ong ! And I had the mike on the inner door , so you really heard what nobody ever heard . ( booms ) No one 's ever been in there when they did that . ( squeaking ) Jerry Lewis : Chalk on the board ... it bothered me watching it . Oh . ( chewingloudly ) ( sneezes ) The sneeze . ( loudnoise ) Jerry Lewis : I used a grizzly bear 's growl for that . ( loudhisses ) ( dropsechoing ) I had about 26 sounds . A book . ( @loud_thud ) Nobody realizes how loud a book can be . Now you enlarge that sound . No , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcover . ( pianointroplays ) ( hornblows ) ( laughterandcheering ) Is someone giving birth back there ? Name it after me . These are the glasses that we are seriously contemplating using for some of the sequences . Let me try the other one's now . Oh , God , that pinches . Profile smile ... to see that the teeth are correct . ( manlaughs ) This is the makeup with a little more red . Murphy : I do get to stretch more when I put stuff on , because you have whatever your baggage is when you show up , and your little stuff that people expect of you . When you 're somebody else , they do n't know what to expect . You get to do a lot of different things . And Jerry did that , you know , before anybody as well . Hello , Los Angeles tower . This is Eddie 's Airways , the airline for the birds . Ha-ha-ha ! A little pun . Chase : I think of him put in a situation the way you put Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got this stuff on his nose . Do n't tell me that that had n't occurred to Jerry a few years earlier . ( laughs ) Battle stations ! ( ringingbells ) Murphy : Peter Sellers gets credited with doing stuff like that . Jerry 's doing it before everybody 's doing multiple character stuff . Chase : This guy ... me , Fletch , using multiple funny costumes that I wore ... if it in any way rang of Jerry Lewis , I 'm proud of it . - Man : Your name , sir . - Uh , Bugs Peyton . What is it again ? I said Bugs Peyton . My name ... Bugs Peyton . Mugs Peyton ? Hey , schmuck , Bugs , not Mugs . What 's this there ? A television ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - What business are you in ? - I 'm a priest . ( crewlaughing ) Man : You 're a priest ? Yeah , free rites at the Mormon Tabernacle Temple in Idaho . Man : You look Jewish to me . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Jerry should get a Kennedy Center honor . Jerry Lewis : Jack came out of the service when Dean and I were playing the Chez Paree in Chicago . And we lived at the Ambassador East . I had a suite on the north side and Jack 's suite was on the south side . And he would come in to me every once in a while and asked me what I thought of this paragraph , and he reads it . And about the third time he came in with something , I said , \" Are you doing a speech ? Are you appearing somewhere ? \" He said , \" No , this is something else . I 'm calling it ' Profiles in Courage . \" ' I said , \" Really ? \" The book that became my bible . I 'd give my soul if I could have dinner with Jack Kennedy again . He never ever spent time with me that I did n't hear something I never wanted to forget . One day we were in Hyannis Port and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Kennedy told me for sure ... \" Do n't get into anything political . You 're gon na lose half your audience . \" Whenever I came to see Jack Kennedy , he made sure I came up through the bowels of the White House , up through the staircase and into the Oval Office , so that the press did n't ever know I was with him . I had 19 visits and no one ever knew it . I did his last birthday appearance . It was the night of his birthday at the Armory and I was teasing Jack .

Mr . President , it 's me ... Jerry . Remember ? The nut . I voted for you . ( narrating ) I 'll never forget it , as long as I live . Seinfeld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @tires_screech ) It 's even harder to do that than some other forms of comedy where you have dialogue and character . Just get in a car and make me laugh . ( hummingatune ) ( Seinfeldchuckling ) That is not easy . ( womanoverspeaker ) Fella ! Yes , Stepmother . Stepmother : Where 's my car ? Seinfeld : To drive a Rolls Royce and to make the car funny , to drive funny ... no one else has ever done this . This is brilliant . This is sophisticated . You got ta be a genius to figure out how to make a car drive funny , so that you watch the car and you laugh at the car . Enjoy your ride , Stepmother . I fixed the car perfectly mechanically beautifully . ( wheezes ) Seinfeld : This is not lowbrow to me . This is the highest brow . Jerry Lewis , Noel Coward ... you know , right there . ( carcreaking ) - My name is Bettina Bailey . - What is it ? - Bettina . - Bettina ? - Bettina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to let you know my lifelong dream , if you would n't mind , to hug you , please . Here ? ( laughter ) Now ? Or if you got a room back there , you know , either way . ( laughter ) It 's so nice of you . I 'll tell you what : After the show , if you come backstage , I will let security know to let you in . I will give you a hug , but I can not promise you that it 'll end there . Woman : On Myspace , they asked , \" Who would you most like to meet ? \" Well , my number one was God , - but my number two was you . - ( crowdexclaims ) So maybe we can make it a threesome with Bettina - and let me come back , get a hug ? - ( laughterandcheering ) I 'm gon na be busy , ai n't I ? Is the drug store open ? You do n't need it . I 've gone through menopause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , two , three , four ... What I do when I dance is fake . ( laughs ) I am one of the faking fools . The dancing became a part of the writing process . ( swingmusicplaying ) What I love about Jerry is , he 's never had a dance lesson in his life , he told me . He fakes it . Well , goodness me , he fakes better than I dance . ( swingmusiccontinues ) I know nothing about dancing other than time , rhythm . I stood in the wings watching my dad at the ripe age ... five , six , seven , eight . I mean , I watched some of the best dancers in the world . He was trying to experiment with comedy in a weird way that Gene Kelly was trying to experiment with what you could do with dance in movies . ( fanfare ) ( percussionintroplays ) ( jazzorchestraplaying ) Jerry Lewis : I gave the crew the setup . I had tracks . Music was ready . And I had to be ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own choreography . I did that in take one . Two setups ... I did the whole dance . The front office was in shock because I shot that whole sequence in four hours . I went up the stairs in eight seconds . - ( @clock_chimes ) - I think I 'll have to get along . I 'll never forget you . Jerry Lewis : 66 steps in eight seconds . But at the top of the steps I had a heart failure . I was in Mount Sinai Hospital 30 minutes later . The insurance company did n't want to pay us . They did n't believe I made it in eight seconds . And they kept looking at the film . I said , \" The film do n't lie . \" 66 steps in eight seconds . ( chuckles ) While I 'm in the oxygen tent , my father opens the flap , looks in and says , \" Do you know what you 're doing to your mother ? \" My baby . I 'm lying here , hoping I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I 'm doing to my mother . It was a perfect Jewish question . Oh , my child . ( laughter ) Seinfeld : He 's a brilliant musician of comedy . Comedy is math and music . It 's very precise and mathematical , but it has to have a musical kind of flow to it . ( playingfanfareintro ) Maybe it could be just a touch faster . Okay ? Same thing . Thanks . If you waved your arms faster , it would have been faster . ( musicianslaughing ) They played exactly what you were doing . Belzer : I watched JL rehearse a 36-piece orchestra and know every instrument . I mean , this is a musical genius in the true sense . ( orchestrastopsplaying ) Train wreck . ( laughter ) - Rick , where did that happen ? - We 've got it covered . ( laughing ) Jerry Lewis : When you get music in your soul and you are then becoming a creative artist ... I could never just put music over there . It was always imbued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in \" The Patsy , \" I do the kid that has tickets for the premiere but he 's not dressed for it . I chewed that scene for four days till I got it exactly the way I wanted it . And then , when I scored it , I still did n't get it perfect . And then I took one of the pieces of music that we had recorded and I Mickey-Moused it to go ... ( imitatessped-upmusic ) And it was one spot where it needed it . And it made it happen really , really good . I was very proud of the work . You know , you put a comic on the screen for an audience for eight minutes ... that 's almost a reel . ( musicslowsdown ) Without the music it would have been a whole , long eight minutes . The music moved it . It gave it that thing that an audience sitting in the theater needs to be told . - ( musicvamping ) - Pull the tracks out of there and look at it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with wrong music . When you talk of comedy as the art form , it demands what music gives it . The trombone will play D-flat , you play E , and you play E-sharp , okay ? Listen to this , folks . ( dissonantchordplays ) Man : That is the shit . There 's always one that do n't belong there , but if it was out of there , it 'd be perfect . ( laughter ) - Thanks , Jerry . - Okay . Good night , ladies and gentlemen . - Do we have a gentleman ? - No . Good . Screw them . Cough . When you have a guy in the band who 's better than everybody else at his instrument , you got ta hear a solo . ( hummingatune ) And the same with Jerry ... you know , you want to see Jerry in a funny movie , and then you want to see him just do a solo , ' cause he 's that good . ( orchestraplayingjazz ) ( trombonesoloplaying ) ( trumpetsoloplaying ) ( musicfinishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened September the 4th , 1976 , that created the most talk in the world of television . ( studioapplause ) I have a friend who loves what you do every year . Arthur Forrest : This is quite a story that almost nobody knows . It was 1976 . And the phone rang . It 's Frank Sinatra . He said , \" If I was to bring Dean on the show , how do you think he 'd react ? \" And I said , \" I think he would react marvelously . \" And they had n't really reconciled yet . Forrest : And he says , \" I 've arranged it . He wants to do the show . \" We did n't tell anybody because we knew if it leaked out , I would be a dead man . They said , \" He 'd come up in a limo with seven or eight people and Dean would be one of them with a raincoat and a hat and glasses . \" I said , \" When Frank comes out , make sure all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the PR people you can in the audience . It 's gon na be a big story . \" They said , \" What is it ? \" I said , \" I ca n't tell you , but just trust me . \" Sinatra : Just tell him out there to come in . ( @cheering_and_applause ) Jerry Lewis : We would meet for the first time in 20 years only because of the stupidity of when people get highly emotional . And we both felt badly about that . And I 'm looking , and I went , \" Oh my gosh , that 's Dad walking out , \" ' cause I could tell his walk . And then when I saw his face and I saw Jerry 's face and they hugged ... Chris Lewis : That scream that came out of that audience of 750 people ... I mean , it sounded like 750,000 people . It was just amazing . Jerry Lewis : People love to know that love prevails . So how have you been ? ( laughter ) Jerry Lewis : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see one another . And then they got back . And when they kissed and hugged at that last moment , it was worth all of that . We have n't seen each other for 20 years . ( laughs ) Yeah . Well , you know , there was all those rumors about our breaking up , and then when I started the show and you were n't here , I believed it . Everybody was just dumbfounded . There was n't a dry eye in the house . So you 're working ? ( @laughter_and_applause ) I love your movies . You 're , like , the only thing my parents and I can agree on . What did you think of the Eddie Murphy movie ... \" The Nutty Professor \" movie ? I produced it . What do you think I thought of it ? After you cashed the check , what did you think of it ? It was my financial pleasure , I guarantee you . ( laughs ) As a filmmaker , I 've been inspired by Jerry . And one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutty Professor . \" When I got the chance to do that again , that was like , \" This has to be incredible . \" Because of my love for this man , this artist , it was like , \" There 's no way we 'll do this movie and not , you know , crush it . \" He was able to look at Jekyll and Hyde and see that , hey , that 's funny that you could be this double life and all that whole stuff . That 's what 's really brilliant about \" The Nutty Professor . \" John Landis : I thought Eddie was extraordinary . I thought his character as Sherman Klump was an absolutely extraordinary character , and sweet . Murphy : That 's another thing that 's pioneered by Jerry ... mixing sweet and funny . You do n't see that until Jerry Lewis . You see funny and you see madcap and you see slapstick , but a character really sweet and funny ... that 's Jerry . You ca n't do comedy unless you know drama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . And you ca n't be funny unless you know what the reality is . He mastered that very early . You may not believe this , but I was a very homely child . ( laughter ) Burnett : He was amazing ... amazing to work with . Really ? Yes . My father suggested plastic surgery . Oh , yeah ? When are you gon na have it ? ( laughs ) I had it already . They did a very unusual job . Burnett : A lot of clowns can do straight stuff . I loved him in \" King of Comedy . \" You go that far out ... it 's easier to bring it back in . ( crowdclamoring ) Jerry ! Jerry ! Jerry Lewis : I am fortunate I crossed over as strongly as you can in \" The King of Comedy . \" If you are equipped to do physical , wild craziness as I have and do ... I love ... argh ! Oh , I with it comes an authoritative figure that comes from down deep that can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ratings , the same guests , the same questions ... I 'm just not enjoying it anymore . I got more critical acclaim from that film that I did for any of the work that I did in my whole life . Critics acclaiming , acclaiming , \" Oh , he was this , \" and I 'm thinking to myself , \" You schmuck , do you realize I showed up and I just read the words and went home ? \" I mean , I did n't have to do anything . I had to be me . Crystal : Maybe the best performance he gave was \" King of Comedy , \" you know , as a serious actor . That was harnessing him in a different way . That was another side of Jerry . Oh , he was great in it . And he embraced who he was . And he ... you know , it was n't the Jerry that we knew . He was a different guy . You listen to my stuff for 15 minutes , that 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a life , okay ? - Well , I have a life too . - That 's not my responsibility . Well , it is when you tell me to call you and then you do n't ... I told you to call to get rid of you . In the Scorsese film he 's more of a leading man than he ever was in any film , and he was older . This is a leading man ? Well , actually I was just mixing these so that we could try using it on the skin . You wonder , what kind of career would Lewis have had if he decided he wanted to play really kind of straightforward , good-looking leading man . Lewis could have done that . - ( applause ) - You 're very wise . ( laughter ) Now if you 'll just hold it a second , I 'll thrill you some more . Seinfeld : He came up with the character of Buddy Love . He wanted to take the worst qualities of the worst people he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You rude , discourteous egomaniac . You 're crazy about me , right ? And I can understand it . Only this morning , looking in the mirror before shaving , I enjoyed seeing what I saw so much , I could n't tear myself away . ( kisses ) Have some , baby ? Seinfeld : And he was shocked to find that a lot of young people loved Buddy Love . Thank you , kiddies . You 're all very , very nice little boys and girls . Seinfeld : Jerry is incapable of not putting love into everything he does . Buddy Love , as mean as he tried to play him ... That 's good for you . Buddy Love is loveable , as much as he wanted him not to be . Harrelson : If you did n't know it was Jerry Lewis and you just met both of those guys , you would n't know that it was the same person . So it 's amazing how he created those two completely distinct characters . I do n't want to be something that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's just a guy who truly understands the material and he can just go to the depth that he needs to go to make it really , you know , touching and emotional . ( sighs ) You might as well like yourself . Just think about all the time you 're gon na have to spend with you . He probably could have made a lot of films that he did n't make . He 's that talented . Scott Lewis : In 1995 , when he did \" Damn Yankees , \" it was just about the most exciting thing I can ever remember my dad doing in his career . Chris Lewis : I was there for opening night on Broadway . And I was in a number of cities with him around the country . It 's such a great experience for him . People would say to me , \" Your dad is 70 years old and he 's doing eight shows a week , my God . \" I said , \" Are you kidding ? He would pay to get eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people onstage , it becomes a family . And that 's his ideal situation . That 's perpetual motion for him . It will keep him going , you know , with fuel forever and ever and ever . Crystal : I saw him in \" Damn Yankees . \" The Devil has a big song called \" Those Were the Good Old Days . \" But when Jerry does it , it becomes 25 minutes long . Suddenly he 's doing this cane thing . It has nothing to do with \" Damn Yankees . \" \" Throw me a cane . A cane for ... \" And the canes are flying . And suddenly you 're in ... it 's burlesque and you might as well be seeing Chaplin . Sit there and enjoy for 20 minutes the genius of a guy who , you know , is one of the few who can do this . So I went backstage and I just looked at him and I went , \" The canes . \" And he just ... he said , \" I know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got to . \" \" Paris Match \" one , \" Paris Match \" two ... - very glad to see you . - \" Paris Match \" three ... ( JerryLewisnarrating ) \" Time \" Magazine ran \" The Most Popular People In the World By Appearance , \" and one was the president , two was Muhammad Ali ... Jerry Lewis : How are you ? Where do you want me ? Let 's go . ( narrating ) ... three was Mao Tse-tung , and four was the Pope and Jerry Lewis , who tied . The year after that , I made four by myself . It was very nice . This would n't get printed right here . ( manlaughs ) You got ta go here . Yeah . Man : Yeah , that 's perfect . You should act like that . Oh , you like that ? Here , grab that . How 's that ? ( mumbles ) Are you finished ? I 'm through . ( laughing ) Man : Can I have a little bit more ? Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( screams ) ( tromboneplaying ) \" The Nutty Professor \" inspired everything I did afterwards , as far as my career . \" The Nutty Professor \" is his baby . Jerry is actually going to be directing it on Broadway . He said , \" I want you to play that character . \" Jerry Lewis : Marvin Hamlisch and Rupert Holmes have written 12 numbers already . I 'm gon na be the Jewish George Abbott . He directed his last show when he was 99 . - ( @camera_shutters_clicking ) - Jerry Lewis : It 's very interesting , because of all of the work and all of the silliness that made children laugh that come to me now and say , \" I 've grown up with you . \" What they 're saying is , \" I 'm not coming to you as the adult to proclaim this . I come to you as the child that recognizes the child that did it . \" Harrelson : There 's something that came through about him that made America and the world fall in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this incredible childlike brilliance . I let you talk me into this ridiculous chair because I felt sorry for you . - Now just open there . - Look , I do n't need this . - Oh , there . - You missed . You missed . - No , you missed now , Herbert . - You missed . Jerry Lewis : People want to make contact with someone that advanced their childhood through humor , and it 's a very special thing . It gives me the kind of energy to come forward and do more . Generation after generation is rediscovering , rediscovering him . When they see him , they become the 10-year-old that they were the first time they saw him . Jerry Lewis : Most of my audience was six and eight and 11 when I exploded on the scene . And now they got children who have children who want to see Jerry . ( @laughter_and_applause ) Tarantino : As far as like his fan base , that required children to be renewed and get involved in Jerry Lewis movies . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richard Lewis : Worldwide , children , no matter what language they spoke , they got him . You know , you try to find a comedian who can , you know , score in Iceland and then do a nightclub date in Brooklyn . Not happening , man . Oh ... Burnett : They do n't even have to know what he 's saying . It 's in his face . It 's in his body . It 's in everything that he ... he 's just ... he 's just funny . Harrelson : What 's cool to me is , I was getting ready to go to bed and my daughter says , \" You want to watch a movie , Daddy ? \" \" I guess I could watch something . What do you want to watch ? \" She said , \" Can we watch a Jerry movie ? \" Hey ! \" Can we watch Jerry Lewis ? \" I was like , \" You bet we can . \" ( blowsair ) There 's not one film that Jerry Lewis has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his stuff just like you watched it then . And it 's funny just like it was back then . It 's timeless . And it 's accessible family entertainment forever , forever and ever . Crystal : If you look at those homo sapiens things ... it 's a monkey , then it 's a guy walking this way ... if it was comedy , it would be circus clowns and then it would be the court jesters . And then it starts to ... there 's this guy walking , and it 's Charlie Chaplin . Then it 's Harold Lloyd . Then it 's Keaton . And then there 's Jerry and he 's walking on his ankles . He 's just one of the great comedy directors , you know , not only of his era but of all time . Murphy : You can see his influence on a couple of different generations of people , you know , and not just as a comic but as a filmmaker . You see his impact all over the place . ( jazzorchestraplaying ) Alec Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years or so ... they have a debt to Lewis and what he did . ( Frenchaccent ) Are you the father of Jim Carrey ? I banged his mother many years ago . Landis : And he 's got this legacy ... his films and his television shows . What 's incredible about Jerry Lewis is how long he 's been in the public eye . The only true test is time . And , you know , people are still watching Jerry 's pictures . Thank you . Murphy : Who 's done that , an 80-year run ? Has anyone done that ? That has to be some kind of record . Chase : We all know who Jerry Lewis is in some way . We know that he 's a serious man . He 's accomplished a great deal . I 'm not saying he 's the greatest human . I 'm not comparing him to FDR . Eleanor ... maybe . Baldwin : He really is the Marlon Brando of comedy films . He 's the Marlon Brando . Where everyone apes Brando , everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman . - Hey , lady ! - Herman . - Hey , lady . - He-hey ! - Classic , classic . Seinfeld : It 's hard to be silly in a way that makes people laugh . Being silly is like ... is like being an astrophysicist . You have to be incredibly sophisticated to be silly . Some people look at Jerry Lewis and do n't understand that what he 's doing is extremely sophisticated at its silliest . There he is . Do you think I should do the whole body ? Belzer : He 's from another planet . It 's very hard for anyone , I think , to totally understand Jerry Lewis in the entirety of who he is as a man , who he is as an artist , who he is as an industry , as a philanthropist . I mean , he 's like a mountain . Some people get caught in the foothills of him , but you have to really scale the peaks to truly appreciate the phenomenon of Jerry Lewis . Oh-hh ! I 'm infinitely grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beat Burns . - ( laughter ) I got ta beat Burns . I just put my daughter in college , so I have to wait four years for that to work . But then I 'm gon na have her meet a very nice young man . And then she 's gon na get married . I 'm gon na walk down the aisle with her . And then I 'm gon na be in the hospital to see the baby . - ( laughter ) - So that 's my plan for the next 16 years . And I hope you 'll all join me . Thank you so much . I think Jerry Lewis 's legacy will simply be the familiarity , the household familiarity of the name Jerry Lewis . I think that says it all and will always say it all ... Jerry Lewis . Jerry Lewis : Audiences will look at me and I will say , \" I 'm blessed . What I have been able to do with my life has been extraordinary . But until I leave here tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what my dad taught me ... \" Go out to do one thing ... sweat . \" - Man : Should we start the intro ? - Yeah .

Who are you ? My real name is Laszlo Kerik . I was born in Hungary . A few years ago my wife and I came to America . I was an engineer before . We came here looking for work . We took an apartment in a building . It was a building they wanted lo control . The men I saw ? They got most people out of the building . One night they came ... and they fired some shots . To scare us . So we would leave . A bullet went through a wall ... and my daughter was killed while she slept . We were going to testify . My wife and I . The man responsible for it all ... Alphonse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trial . And they were followed . He was afraid to use his own guys , so ... they sent a crew of Albanians after us . They killed my wife . And they thought they killed me too . And they should have made sure of it . Cigarette ? Yeah . When I manage to forget what happened to me . When there are no mirrors , and no people that reminds me . And my mom makes me laugh . These moments . I have hope . Maman says that I ... that it 's these moments that makes the pain bearable . These moments ... I should try and find them where I can and ... hang onto them . But they 're fleeting . And then I remember and ... I 'm filled with so much hale ... that I want to set the whole world on fire . I 'm sorry I made you tell about your family . I do n't want to be one of those people that reminds you . You 're the one who is going to help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat . And you might have used up all your luck . So ... It 's yellow . Chartreuse . Keep it . I need you around . Rabbits do n't come in chartreuse . Did you eat the cookies ? No . Maman makes a good cookie . I only ask you to return the Tupperware . She likes her Tupperware . Have you made any progress ? I will . I know . Because I realize now if I call the police and tell them what I saw ... it 's not prison you 're afraid of . It 's that you wo n't get lo finish your revenge . I 'm going to steep in my own bed . And why are you going to sleep in your own bed ? Because Daddy takes care of the monsters . All right , baby . Tell me once more , all right ? Because Daddy keeps care of the monsters . That 's not the biggest smile you have . That 's not the biggest smile you have . And why are you going to sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monsters .

I do n't want to lose you too . Now you know everything . No . No , I do n't . How come an engineer knows so much about guns ? Military service . Back home . So , what you said on the phone . Is that your plan ? To get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I just need to get the Albanians there , too . There are many men . But , your bombs does n't work . They work .

I 'll be around long enough to do what you asked me to do . I do n't want you to do that . Bring me food . My morn likes lo cook . It would just go to waste otherwise .

I gave that great lecture on Elvis Presley and the 1950s ... but today we have to change gears and talk about something ... that 's a little bit deeper , a little harder to get at ... which is the Civil Rights Movement , or the black freedom struggle ... or what some historians have called the second reconstruction . Which I really like because it ties it to the first reconstruction after the Civil War ... to show that there is a continuum ... there is a constant struggle on the part of African-Americans in the South ... to claim their freedom , their liberty . And without a doubt ... World War ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go overseas to fight Hitler ... you get shot at , you see your friends killed ... you 're gon na come home a different person .

Defeat Hitler and fascism and its racist policies ... but also defeat Jim Crow and the racist South . And they tried to do that , but they needed some help ... and without question , in one of the most important-I can feel - I can feel the presence of almighty God in this room . Yes !

It is as if we where an American film . And the guy ... I 'll give you an offer you can not say no to . Listen Franco . We need help a friend from Trapani to Rome . Calabrese , formerly dealt with apartments . Now he deals with drugs , weapons . They have political patronage- and until someone in the police force . Banda della Magliani is back . And Casalesi behave like assholes . - We have to do something about it . - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to others . - I send Peppuccio . He is merciless and he 's already people in the area . The other problem then ? Davide ... He 's a good guy , but he has no stake . He 's weak . According to me he is useless unlike his friend Vito . - They are sloppy . Two petty thieves . - Vito is a man . He has been married to flowing into your eyes . You must keep an eye on Vito . He can take care of something simple , a club , or the like . From now on , so keep I an eye on him . By the way , he talks way too much for by priests . Post by ? Is he more Catholic than my mom ? - How 's business ? - Good , you can ask the cashier about it .

Ya . Satan American . He started run things in Palermo . It 's that time of Toto Riina and Carleonesi . You start you do not do those vitamins . Vito has always been responsive . But what you do not know Vito is that we got a lot of shit of this Mancino . - What about New York ? - We do not ask for help yet . But we must act and think as in the past . We need to keep the rest of family out of this . Did you call on us for already know everything ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Barbarians a taste so that they understand we are hard and we has not weakened . We 'll send them a message . A message that means \" war \" ! - Do you need anything ? - What do you think ? - Want a drink ? - No . Okay then ... Bongiorno , sign . Excuse Roberto . He is a good man . I 'm John ... Mancino . Do not forget that . That 's Luigi . He works with me . He is a sons spy . He is good at . He takes account of things I need to know . He has been eyeing up some of your new friends . Cortellos ... He finds out what they think , every they go and who they trust . These things . He explains it to me . I listen and listen and listen . Sometimes I even ... What is it ? - A discrepancy . - Yes , that word . There is a woman hangs all the time with them . She pops up here and there without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different name . She calls herself Adele . Who is the woman ? Why does she do that ? How did she get in there ? It is not easy to infiltrate with such types . Then I got out there for that kind secrets cleans easily . Her real name is not the which she has presented itself as is Mary . - Yes , I 'm Mary . - Okay . Then we found out that Maria experienced something horrible . Something terrible . Her husband was murdered . So why she hangs with them and are so friendly and nice ? She shows up at all their parties ... He , who is very smart says : \" What if it is the who murdered her husband ? \" Why would she hang with killers ? Those who have done terrible things . Why ? - Revenge . - Is that what you want ? Luigi is very smart . There he listed out . Do not worry . There is no danger . Luigi wants a flower , but he gets none . This is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared , huh ? Vito , why are you here ? Do they trust not in me anymore ? Obviously they trust you . They thought you had come to provide you .

The people of Genoa wants him dead . He ? ? does not respect the rules . He has formed a gang and has tried to take over a part of Palermo . A large part of Sicily . What are you talking about ? Have they come from America to take over Palermo ? Then they have someone who protects them . Where did you hear that crap ? The information has come directly from New York . I stood behind the door so I could not fail to hear it . They have told us to be quiet , but I think it ends badly . The bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you understand ? Vito end up stories . Be quiet . Be sure to stay away from bullets . Motherfuckers not kidding . Listen , Mary . I 'm not one to mince the words . I 'm not rich right now . I 'm not the type that comes with gifts . Okay ? So here 's the deal . I always expect something in return . I 'll give you what you need for your revenge . Okay ? Together We will delete Cortellofamiljen from the map . Are you in ? There is a problem . You are a woman . I 'm not inclined to let a woman do what I ask of you . Honestly So are girls pretty emotional . If you plan to implement it here consider you are no longer that woman . You can be a mother when you want it . But when you 're having me to no lovers ... Your lover is a weapon . And you are my weapon . And I can use it How I want and when I want . In return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise . But I do not want your son to know anything about it . - Got it ? - Yes . - In Sicily , it is big news . - What ? - Mary . - Which Mary .

You must be on your guard . I will gather all my men and solve the problem . - Good . We heard . - Keep me posted . Goodbye . Michele , I do not see why you asked me to come ? It is very serious , Don Cimino . It 's about the American . I have been out talking to Franco . Do not worry . Believe me , he 's a very dangerous guy .

( STRUGGLING ) ( SHUSHING ) ( **29;3314;TOOLONG ) - KENNEDY : Morning , partner . - Hey . When did they call it in ? About three hours ago . A couple of joggers found her after the tide went out . Watch your step here , it 's a bit dicey . Victim is Caucasian female , mid-20 's suffered severe trauma from apparently falling off this structure right over here . I 've also got a partial ID . Found a British passport that lists her as a Samantha Walker and a driver 's license that shows a local address in Hollywood . Why only partial ? She was out here for most of the night . Seems like maybe the local wildlife took a run at her . See if you can find someone to confirm the identity . Track down the next of kin . If she 's got a visa , State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white to the residence , talk to the landlord , neighbors , anybody who maybe knew her . All right . Sheriff report a car , abandoned car , missing car somewhere ? No , not that I 'm aware of . Yep , she did n't get here on her own . - A long way from Hollywood . - Yep . - Someone saw her . - Copy that . ( HELICOPTERBLADESWHIRRING ) SOLDIER : Walker , the man needs to see you . You wanted to see me , sir . Give us a minute . You are aware that all voice and e-mail communications sent to and from this base are monitored under standard security protocols ? Well , of course , yeah . We received this yesterday while you were on patrol . I 'm sorry , Walker , there is no easy way to say this . Your daughter was found dead after an apparent drug overdose earlier this week in Los Angeles . This ca n't be right . This ca n't be right . It 's a mistake , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually still there . They 'll need you to sign off on it before it can be shipped back to London for burial . I 'm gon na have to get the next chopper out of here . Yeah , well , it 's not as simple as that . Look , I know this is hard for you to understand , but when you signed your contract extension with Everest last March , you gave up certain liberties that government military personnel are allowed . You ca n't be serious . We 've been tasked with a major staging operation in coordination with the arrival of a senator from the States . We 'll need you for full tactical support . We 're talking about my daughter here . And you are a team leader at Everest . What the fuck has that got to do with anything ? Risk versus reward . When we brought you in from the British military , you were making less than ? 30,000 a year . At Everest , you 're making more than four times that . Now you listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be abandoning your operational post . No contractor in the world would touch you . Yeah ? Well , fuck you and yours . ( DAUGHTERGIGGLING ) ( NICKSPEAKSINDISTINCTLY ) Anyone there ? Hold on a minute , mate . ( @door_closes ) What the hell are you doing here ? I thought you were still abroad . Yeah , well , things did n't quite go as planned . Fancy a drink ? I think I still got whiskey down here . Yeah , I 'll come down . WALKER : Listen , Nick , I just want to say thanks . I appreciate you looking after the place . NICK : Just wish it were under better circumstances . Yeah . You know , it 's funny ... We used to collect these from restaurants all over the world whenever we were on holiday . Melissa thought we 'd settle in this place . That we would build a life together having these dinner parties with plates from all over the world . I think it made me laugh . And it was a very good conversation piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we got to travel abroad was when ... Was when I got new orders . Grounded on the base ... No way to raise a kid . When was the last time you heard from her ? Months ago . I mean , after her mom died ... ( SIGHS ) Things kind of drifted . One month led to another month and then before you know it , we lost contact . I forget ... I forget how hard it was for her growing up in Los Angeles . I should have been there for her . I should have been a better dad , made the effort . Surprised you got back so early . They give you any problems when you asked for the time off ? Only for the fact because I told them to go fuck themselves . That 's classy . No matter where you seem to go , there 's more than likely a bridge that 's gon na get burned down . I do n't know how you made it in the military for as long as you did . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . But I 'm done with it now , I 've had enough . Twenty five years in service . Time to try something new . Any ideas ? No , not yet . But I 'm working on it . Look , Nick , I do n't want to put it on you , but I need your help . I need you to sort some stuff out for me . I need to ... I need to get rid of this house . The only things that are left here now are just memories I 'd rather forget . In this market , you 're not gon na get what it used to be worth . That do n't matter . There 's enough in this to at least get me started again . I 'll make some calls when you head over to the States . I 'm not with you , what do you mean , back to the States ? When you fly back to the States . I 'm not going anywhere , mate . You do n't know , do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . Please tell me that you are fucking kidding me . They were supposed to bring her home tomorrow . After you contacted us , I thought you would have heard . No , because they cut all communication when I left the base . Fucking hell . You got your phone on you ? Back at the house . WALKER : I 'm gon na need you to go and get it for me . I 'm gon na phone the airlines and get a direct flight out of here . That 's been here the whole time ? Well , it ai n't much , but it 's better than putting it in the bank . Give me five minutes . DR . HOLDEN : Listen , I apologize , Mr . Walker , for the delay . It 's been a bit slow down here today . Please do n't worry , I understand . Go ahead . What is this , some sort of a joke ? That 's not my daughter , that 's not Sam . I understand this can be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I 'm telling you , you 're not listening to me . This is not my daughter . It 's not Sam . Just give me a second , hold on , let me check on this real quick . This ... This has got to be some mistake . How was she originally identified ? We just brought her in under standard procedures . Mr . Walker ? ( @knocking_on_door ) ( LINETRILLING ) CATHY ON MACHINE : Hi , this is Cathy , I 'm not around , but I will call you back . MALE VOICE ON VOICEMAIL : Welcome to the offices of Most Industries . Our office hours are between 10:00 a.m . and 5:30 p.m . , Monday through Friday .

How may I direct your call ? Samantha Walker , please . I 'm sorry , can you please hold for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I direct your call ? Yeah , I need to talk to a Samantha Walker . Can I have your name , please ? Is there a Samantha Walker in your department ? Miss Walker no longer works for us . Well , I 'm sorry to hear that . I need your address , please , of your corporate offices . We 're at 11579 , Fulton in Century City . What 's this in regards to ? God morning , how you doing ? SECURITY GUARD : Good morning . I have an appointment scheduled with Most Industries today . Karl Schuuster ? Yeah , yeah , that 's exactly who it is . I have n't seen him come by yet . Well , I like to be early for these types of things . You know what it 's like . You know what they say , early bird gets the worm and all that . Just sign in there for me , please . Yep . You can take the elevator , 11th floor . Appreciate it , thanks . ( @elevator_bell_dings ) Most Industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hi , yeah , good morning . Uh , I 'm here to inquire about my daughter , Samantha Walker . Do you recognize her ? Sorry , Most Industries , how may I direct your call ? You 're the girl I spoke with earlier . One moment , please . I 'm sorry , Mr . Schuuster is n't meant to be in the office today , but if you 'd like to leave your number , I 'll be glad to let him now you stopped by . Well , thanks very much . Is that his office ? - No , sir , you ca n't go up there . - Is that his office ? Sir ... Excuse me , sir ! Sir , you ca n't go up there ! Sir ! You ca n't just run upstairs ! So I need all those numbers in place . You guys cross-check , okay ? - MARISSA : You ca n't go up there ! - What the hell is this ? MARISSA : Sir , excuse me , sir ! Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . That 's okay , honey . Thanks , Marissa , it 'll be all right . You 're Karl Schuuster ? Uh , yeah , yes , I am . Um , you got me at a little disadvantage here . My name 's Lex Walker . I do n't know what 's going on here , but let me just start off with a little apology . See , I got a terribly hectic schedule today , I 'm gon na be tied up . In the interest of speeding things up , what can I do for you ? What are you here for ? You knew my daughter , Samantha Walker ? Hmm ... Is that right ? Yeah , she worked for you . Well , for at least this company anyway . Well , I understand why you 'd think that , but something you should know is that I have hundreds of employees and I guess a pretty large portion of them I 've never met , and I 'm afraid your daughter is one of them . Well , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do me a favor , Saphire should be sitting right outside that office . Would you ask him to come in and show this gentleman down to human resources , thanks . And now , Mister , uh , Walker , um , I 've got a webinar presentation . She was killed over a week ago . And the body they were gon na ship back to London was n't hers . Your corporate office was one of the last numbers she called . Uh , jeez , I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm very sorry to hear about that , accept my condolences . I just need some help . Tell me the last time she was here , times , dates , anything , please , I 'm begging you . I 'd really love to help you , but if you came here for those answers from me , I 'm sorry , again , I really am . I do n't know , this city , it 's ... I do n't know , it just gets rougher ... It 's rotten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? It 's just ... I never mentioned the color of her hair . I 'm sorry , uh ... Saphire . Please , just look at her picture . That 's her . It 's a different girl , it 's not Sam . Sorry . Can you show him downstairs , please , guys ? All right . Good luck to you . Follow me . MARISSA : Certainly , sir , just one moment . Transferring you now . MARISSA : Most Industries . One moment , please . - There 's one other thing . - It 's time to leave . You want to watch that hand , mate . You might just lose it . From a proper gent like you ? I do n't think so . Most Industries . And I 'm not asking you again . I need security to suite 712 immediately ! Down ! Down ! Get on the ground now ! On your knees ! Down ! Get your hands behind your back . ( SIGHS ) MICHAEL : I could swear I just left here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my ass . Sheriff 's Department pick up a guy on assault charges and immediately contacted us . Last time I checked , we were a major crimes unit . You might want to remind the Lieutenant that next time he calls us in for something like this . KENNEDY : I 'll keep that in mind . The assailant 's a British national . Military contractor , Iraq , Afghanistan . Got picked up at the offices of Most Industries down in Century City . Apparently he got into a heated argument and beat the living daylights out of the security detail . Here 's the catch . He says that his daughter was missing and he was trying to track her down through her last known employer . Her name 's Samantha Walker . Our San Pedro victim ? Yeah , told the arresting officers that they got the wrong girl . Well , find out if there 's any truth to it . Have Henderson pull the file and bring it down here . - Yeah . - I 'll see what I can get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker . Long way across the pond , huh ? How long before I can get out of here ? Well , it 's not that simple . Sure it is . I know all about the American justice system . - Oh , do you ? - Yeah , set the arraignment and let 's go . I 've heard about your daughter . I have a young son . I ca n't imagine what you 're going through . Is there anyone in this town who 'll listen to me ? I 'm gon na say it again for the last time . My daughter 's not dead . The body they were gon na ship back to London is not Samantha 's . Well , maybe you could tell me why you busted up that place . That guy , um , Schuuster ... He 's not telling me everything . He knows Sam . You 're right about that . See , he gave us a full statement today and luckily he 's not gon na press charges . Well , is n't that big of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this date to change his mind , so if I were you , Mr . Walker , I 'd leave it alone . Look , I did not go in there to cause trouble . All I want to do is find my girl , get her safe , and bring her home , that 's it . ( @knocking_on_door ) Excuse me a minute . Do n't worry , mate . I 'll be here . KENNEDY : All right , I pulled the file . Here 's what we 're looking at . There 's not much on her . Some parking tickets and shit , until about a month ago , when she got arrested at a DUI checkpoint at a bar in the Valley called Cabos . Look at this picture . It was taken four weeks ago the night she got arrested . And this one was taken at the crime scene right after they pulled the body from the water . I do n't know , it 's hard to tell , but the limey may be telling the truth . Pull the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My contact at the department said you refused to press charges . Your contact ? That would actually imply that you knew what you were doing . With all due respect , with Walker in jail , it buys us more time . For what ? I mean , if the girl was alive , the easiest way to track her is through the one man that wants her as badly as we do . Now that would be a good idea , do n't you think ? Do n't worry , I 'm on it . You 're on it , you 're on it . See , here 's the thing . You were responsible for all this in the first place . Why in God 's name would I let you go fuck this up over again , why ? We trailed her , from her apartment to the night club , exactly where you said she 'd be . Did you get the right girl ? She fit the description you gave us . Right . You know , when I came to this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corporations were going bankrupt , because of their problems with the union labor , but I changed all that . See I had a lot of cash to lend . There were borrowers all around the block . So basically I ... I painted a new face on the city , I made it look clean . So I became Mr . Wonderful , with love and respect from just about everyone . You respect me , Saphire ? See , I do n't think so , because now , for the first time ever , I got goddamn cops all around my house . Because of you , you fucking moron ! ( SAPHIRECHOKING ) 1881 , Castaic . That 's where he used to live . I want you to go there , gather up the family , anybody with the name of Saphire , make ' em go away . I would love to hear you beg for your life , but you 'd bore the shit out of me . Go on , Baron . Do what I told you . MICHAEL : So these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woman in the photograph . It 's your daughter 's passport , driver 's license and multiple credit cards . You can see how it would be an easy miss . You can justify it all you want , Detective . You got ta admit , you and your men were sloppy . Oh , is that right ? Yeah . Sure has a lot of plastic for a 25-year-old , do n't you think ? Yeah , well , what can I say ? Girls like to shop , do n't they ? Or she got turned upside down , over-extended . What 's this got to do with the fact that my daughter 's missing ? We 're not sure of anything . Total bollocks , the lot of it . Let me ask you a question , Mr . Walker . When was the last time you actually spoke to your daughter ? Are we through here , Detective ? My partner will walk you out . Taxi . Do you know a bar called Los Cabos ? Here 's 100 . Keep it running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be . Fucking slag ! Excuse me . I said , excuse me ! - Can I get a drink ? - What do you need ? How you doing ? I want a whiskey and a pint . What ? A whiskey and a pint . $10.50 . $100 , keep it . Thanks . Let me get a favor . You see that girl ? You ever seen her in here ? No , I 've never seen her around here . You need to take a closer look at this , try it again . Have you seen her in here ? Like I said , I 've never seen her . Well , she got nicked right outside at a DUI checkpoint , about a month ago . They said she was in here . You a cop ? I 'm a long way from home . I 'm just an interested party . Now , have you seen her ? Have n't seen her . Give me another one . And here 's another $100 for you . Now let me jog your fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy on the eyes . She got caught by the police about a month ago leaving this place . Now , have you seen her or not ? ( @glass_shattering ) Now I 've got your attention . Her name is Samantha Walker . Blonde hair , medium height , she 's missing and she 's my daughter . Now , please , please , if there 's anyone who might know anything . I have $10,000 here in cash . For any information that might lead me to her whereabouts . And the cash is yours , if I find her where you tell me . Anyone ? Hey . I know the girl you 're looking for . Is that right ? So where is she ? I tell you that and what 's to guarantee I get paid ? Listen to me carefully , I 'm not playing any games here . But if you are , I 'm gon na be back for this and you ai n't gon na want that , do you get me ? The Roux . I saw her there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the guys that runs the place . So let 's call this a finder 's fee . You take me to that place , you get the rest . That 's bullshit , asshole ! I told you what you wanted to know . If I found her , that was the offer and that was the deal . I mean , for all I know , you could be leading me on some wild fucking chase . How would I know that ? You want the full 10 grand , you show me where she is . Let 's go . MAN : That 's our guy . Call it in . ( @engine_starting ) I ca n't believe I 'm doing this . You could be a serial killer , for all I know . Yeah , that 's right . Something tells me you 'd still drive me around all night if you thought you were gon na get your hands on my money . Whatever . You know my daughter ? That 's what I said , I know her . So where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an old warehouse they transitioned a while back . - Did she work there ? - I do n't know . Well , you said you saw her in there , make up your mind . Yeah , I saw her there . I do n't know what she was doing . I do n't , like , keep track of her , but I saw her . Look , if this is gon na be a waste of my time , you can pull over now and give me my money back . - ( SIGHS ) - Or you can answer my questions . What was she involved in and who was she involved with ? Ricky Cummins , he runs the club . They came in to Cabos a few times after hours to score . And how would you know that ? Because I 'm the one that hooked ' em up . Just get us there . All right , just be cool in here . These guys do n't respond well to hooligans . So what does this geezer look like ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me here . Look , just tell me , what does he look like ? MARGO : Just wait here for me , I 'm cool with them . They 're not gon na respond to you . Be cool , okay ? Excuse me , sorry , sorry , excuse me . - Hi , sorry . - No dudes . - MARGO : Excuse me . - You and your friends are fine . Hey , Romeo , I need to talk to you . I 'm busy . Yeah , I see that . She can take a break . Hey , you 're looking good . So are you , what 's up ? I got this guy with me . RICKY : No , no guys . Why are you here ? See the guy in the brown leather jacket ? He 's asking questions about your girlfriend . What ? I do n't know , look , I just told him I 'd bring him here to talk to you . Just talk to the guy . I do n't know that guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening right now . - So just ... - Why the fuck did you do that ? MARGO : I told him I 'd bring him , what am I supposed to do ? - For what , though ? - I do n't know . I do n't know what he wants . Excuse me , hey , is this the guy ? - Listen , I need to talk to you . This him ? - Hey , I do n't know you , buddy . I need to talk to you for one minute , come here . Fuck ! What the ... Pick up ! Come on , baby ! Pick up ! Honey , pick up the fucking phone ! Pick up the fucking phone ! Just settle down . - All I want to do is talk to you . - All right . Now , listen to me . You see that ? That 's my daughter , Sam . Now she was found dead of an apparent drug overdose . But the body they was gon na ship back to London was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , would you ? No , I would n't . Look , I had no idea about that . - I do n't know why you 're fu ... - ( GRUNTS ) ( COUGHING ) Okay , I might ... I might know a little something about that . Right . She came by the club a couple of weeks ago . Two guys like you came , they picked her up , that 's the last I saw of her . - I 'm telling you the truth . - Do n't give me shit . I told you the fucking truth , buddy . Okay ? - ( @tires_screeching ) - MAN : Lex ! ( BRAKESSCREECHING ) WALKER : Jesus Christ . Get over here ! MAN : Come here right now , Ricky Cummins !

She 's on Wilshire , I can take you . - You 're coming with us . - Okay . Silver one , right there . Get in . ( @tires_screeching ) Just try and get us there in one piece , yeah ? Are you kidding me ? We 're fleeing the scene of a crime ! Well , then , try not to make it so obvious ! ( @tires_screeching ) Directions , where are we going ? Tell her . RICKY : Go over Laurel Canyon . When you get down to Wilshire , hit the 101 South , downtown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So why they after you ? Most Industries is a front , okay ? It does n't exist . It 's a shell Internet company . They steal people 's identities . - Explain to me how . - ( SIGHS ) Credit cards , payroll cards , and they put , like , $5,000 to $10,000 on the cards . They sell them to guys like me for half price . And then I sell them at the club , that 's what I do . You expect me to believe that shit ? I swear to God , I 'm telling you the truth . That 's what we do . So , tell me , how is my daughter involved ? You 'll have to ask her yourself . Do n't worry , mate , I plan on it . ( HELICOPTERBLADESWHIRRING ) ( **28;3345;TOOLONG ) ( @tires_screeching ) - Detectives . - ( @door_closes ) All right , so , we got the call about an hour ago . Witnesses reported a fight broke out outside the club , and spilling out here . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were found lying right there . Description on the assailant ? It all happened so fast , what we got is spotty at best . Spotty what ? Spotty whites , spotty blacks ? Spotty Hispanic ? OFFICER : Uh , Caucasian male , 40 's , large build . One of the bartenders said he had some sort of crazy accent , so he definitely was n't from here . He was seen chasing after the guy who ran the club , a guy by the name of Ricky Cummins . KLEIN : You got any IDs on the victims ? OFFICER : No , no wallets , no cash , they 've just got their own prints on them . Talk to security , find out if they had cameras on top of the doors or is there any kind of surveillance on the exterior of the club . Will do . I want to find out where these guys came from . - Run down that Ricky . - OFFICER : Ricky Cummins . MICHAEL : Run him down . OFFICER : Will do . Double tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accent , military precision , leaves us with about one choice . Yup . Call dispatch , get a couple black and whites out to the residence of Karl Schuuster . Tell them we 'll be following . - You got it . - ( CARLOCKSBEEPING ) Are you sure about this ? Of course , I 'm sure about this . This is the safe house , buddy . We set it up a month ago when she got popped . - So how do we get inside ? - We do n't get inside . Remember when I was running through the parking lot ? I had the phone , I threw it ? That 's the only connection we have . You ca n't get inside right now . - Stay here . - Stay here , what ? You ca n't get inside , I 'm telling you . ( @dogs_barking ) ( CLEARSTHROAT ) What do you want ? Go and tell Sam that daddy 's here to take her home . Man , it 's late , all right ?

All right . - No , that would not be the case . - I got it . - Uh , Detective Michael Klein . - How you doing ? This is my partner , Det ... Hey , uh , look , I was just telling your man over here that , uh , I have the utmost confidence in my security system here and , uh , as you can see , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think you understand the severity of the situation . We are tracking a suspect who 's involved in a shooting on the West side . Left three people dead . Now his description very closely resembles the man who was arrested in your office earlier today . Well , why would you think he 'd come here ? He believes his daughter , who used to work for you , is missing . Miss Walker was found dead of a drug overdose about a week ago , no ? It 's not public knowledge . Well , I 'm sure it 's not . I had this little conversation with a lieutenant earlier today . Chatted a bit . Well , that case is still pending a review . Yeah , right . Well , I mean , it could be , uh ... ( CHUCKLING ) Of course , this is my view , just one of the normal cases where these young kids come in here . Want to be attractive , people who look for their fame and fortune , and , uh , things do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got here , except they look a little worse , you know ? Yeah , that happens . Mr . Schuuster , you may still be able to help us . Have you ever seen these men before ? Um , no , no , I ca n't say that I have . Listen , I really appreciate you looking out for my best interest , but , uh , you 'll have to excuse me . There 's , uh ... I have some special guests I 'd like to attend to . I do n't blame you , yeah . Tell you what , we 'd like to keep a couple officers out front , in case this suspect ... No , no , that 's really not necessary . Just the same . Okay , then , well , you 'll just have to submit a request to the board , uh , you know that oversees these estates . Uh , that would be , I think , the first Tuesday in every month . Anyway , you guys have a nice night , nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We 're happy to have you back . SCHUUSTER : Did you miss me ? Well , I 'm happy to be here . - You believe one word of that bullshit ? - Not one . Call Judge Booth , see if we can get authorization for a surveillance team . - At this hour ? - Let 's wake his lazy ass up . - Thanks . - ( CHUCKLING ) Mmm . Excuse me for a minute , will you , honey ? The last contact was several hours ago . It seems they 've completely fallen off the grid . Listen , gather everybody we got . I want him and her back here . I do n't care if they 're standing or laying down . I want them back here now , come on . Yes , sir . ( SIGHS ) Give me one of those , can you ? Sure . - That good ? - Thanks . You 're welcome . ( SIGHS ) Nobody heard nothing . We should be good for now . No , if he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get packed and moved out of here tonight . ( SIGHS ) I see you 've got your mother 's taste in men . - Present company excluded . - ( WALKERSIGHS ) Easy , there , Dad . It looks like you 've taken a few hits . Yeah , I have , and you know why ? Because I 've been looking for you . I mean , Sam , what was you thinking , disappearing like that without even contacting me . Do n't start with me now . Do you know something ? If your mother was alive ... God , if she was alive , she 'd have been worried sick and panic-stricken . Hmm , but not you . That 's not what I said . I have n't heard from you in months . ( SCOFFS ) Do you know something ? I 've been beaten up , nearly stabbed , shot at , and electrocuted . All things I 'm sure you 've grown accustomed to . Do you have any idea ... Any idea ... What it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was alive or dead , who you was with , where you was . I mean , for all I know , you could have been lying dead in a ditch somewhere ! You know , you never seemed to care before , so why now ? I 'll tell you exactly why . Because you 're the only one I 've got left now . And like it or not , you 're still my daughter . Look , listen to me , there ... There was only one thing I was ever good at . And being a young dad was n't it . But I 'm here now for you . Yeah . Please , you 've got to believe me , I 'm not here to judge you . I do n't care what trouble you 've got yourself into . All I care about is you . That you 're safe and I can bring you home . ( SIGHS ) I needed everyone in my life to believe I was dead . Because if he knew I was still alive , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuuster created a series of Internet banks and an online lending solution . It was a phishing scam . Every applicant that went to the website submitted information that he used to steal their identity . This is a database that contains the names of hundreds of thousands of people that he 's stolen from . So how has he not been caught ? The websites were set up at hosting facilities all over the country . The sites would be up for a week and then removed . Nothing , not even an imprint was left to chance . So how did you get involved in this ? I was hired as a programmer to manage the root access database . Good morning , Most Industries . How may I direct your call ? SAM : Several months ago , I started finding discrepancies in the risk scoring that was used to approve and deny loan applications . So I tracked it through to the credit services department . And that 's when I met ... What , this fucking geezer ? Jesus , Dad . I needed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SAMTYPING ) SAM : I found a way to back up the database , so I could get it in the hands of the FBI . But I knew if they arrested him , he 'd still have the resources to come after me . So I needed a way out . Then I created a series of accounts and identities . And I funded it with 10 million dollars that I got from the Most Industries ledger account . I simply had to merge the new database into the mainframe host processor . And once the cards were created , I could activate the accounts and transfer the funds . Schuuster 's people were never prepared for an internal breach . Are you sure these are clean ? Yeah , I bought the plane tickets with them today . So I need your passport . SAM : Before I had a chance to transfer the funds ... - Mmm . - ( LAUGHING ) I knew I only had a few days before Schuuster found out I was arrested . I was able to get the accounts activated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds . ( BEEPING ) It 's just a small piece of the pie , nothing that he would even notice . Then why did he want you dead ? ( SIGHS ) Well , when I was busted , they caught his cards on me . And then he knew I was a risk to him . And the other girl ? Let me know as soon as you cash them . - Okay , I will . - Thank you so much . Cathy was my roommate . After I ran from the office , I had her met up with Ricky . There was n't enough time . So Ricky was the only one that could still get into the facility . But it was too late . So the money 's in limbo and everyone wants it back . You know , there 's still a way for us to do this clean . Yeah , well , I do n't see that unless we get inside that building . Schuuster has a secondary server set up in his panic room in his estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the office , we just have to get into that room . Yeah , well , how do you propose we do that ? RICKY : I have an idea . There is one thing that he likes better than money . WALKER : What ? I 'm missing something , what is it ? SAM : Escorts . What ? No , no ! Come on , it 's the only way we can get inside . No , look , our deal was 10,000 if I helped you find her . That 's it , done . You 're a target now , just like us . ( SCOFFS ) Bullshit , I am . WALKER : She 's right . I mean , how long do you think it 's gon na be before he finds out you was involved ? Yeah , well , I 'll take my chances . Here you go , 10 grand . Nice doing business with you . Fifty grand . MARGO : You 're gon na have to do better than that , mate . WALKER : All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's make it an even hundred thousand . And how is it we still ca n't tie the rental car to either Most Industries or Karl Schuuster ? We 've been over this . Well , tell me again . The credit card was authorized three days ago . Who made the reservation , who signed for the car , and why is it being declined now ? Credit card was stolen from a Michael Hicks out of Detroit . He was at home , alive and well today . That 's not our guy . - ( SIGHS ) - ( @phone_ringing ) Son of a bitch . ( SIGHS ) This is Klein . WALKER : Are you looking for me , Detective ? Walker . Where are you ? I 'm very , very close by , funny enough . I need a trace on 415 , caller 's on now . I was actually gon na pop in and ask if you fancied a cup of tea , if you were n't too busy . Yeah , no , not at all , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burdon . Sounds really nice , but something tells me there might be a full SWAT team just waiting for me to arrive . Is that how you think this is gon na go down ? Well , to be honest with you , I reckon I 'd get within say 50 feet of the place before you had me cuffed and pinned to the floor . Well , at least that 'll give us time to talk about Ricky Cummins and that night club you tore up last night . That was self-defense . I was attacked . We was nowhere near the night club . If you 're innocent , come in . I 'll help you . What and allow Schuuster to carry on doing what he 's doing ? I do n't think so . There 's nothing to suggest he 's doing anything illegal . And if there was ? If you could pinpoint several murders and executions back to a financial scheme that he himself perpetrated , now what would you do ? Are you in possession of this evidence ? No , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PHONELINEDISCONNECTS ) Not long enough . Let 's go ! ( SIGHS ) ( @tires_screeching ) ( @knocking_on_door ) SAM : So how much time do you think we have ? WALKER : Well , it wo n't take long once you get inside , but listen to me . If anything goes wrong in there I want you to keep your head down and get out as fast as you can , - do you understand that ? - Dad ... Listen , Sam , I 'm serious . Look , I want you to take this . This is a number for a really good mate of mine back in London . I did n't want to tell you , but I 've been saving up since your mom died and all that . But there 's money there for you if anything were to ever happen to me . Thank you , for everything . And you know I love you . - BOTH : Hey . - All right , I 'll see you guys in the car . Yeah . Listen , remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because you 've got the best vantage point . Right . Remember , lights out , keep your eyes open . Okay . When I give you that signal , when you hear anything going down , I need you to be there . - Understand ? - Yeah . - If anything happens there . - Yeah . Listen , I want to say thanks . I appreciate it . ( @engine_starting ) ( KLEINTYPING ) Whoever sent you this knew exactly what they were doing . Look , it 's all names and numbers to me , kid . - Just show me what you 're telling me . - ( SIGHS ) Take Nicholas Fields here , all right ? MAN : Now when you click on him , this window pops up . Which is everything you 're gon na need if you want to create this . Now meet Nick Fields . He 's got over $30,000 in a checking account several credit cards and a debt-income ratio of 42 percent . So , he makes a variation on the naming convention and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a brand new identity . Exactly . Give me a name , just call something out . Michael Hicks . Michael Hicks , originated out of D-town , he 's got accounts over at Sierra National . Pull him up . - That 's our guy . - Yeah . Is there any way you can determine who created this system ? Yeah , better than that . Now whoever developed this database also added a map to the IP where the server that holds the master key is located . So if you match this address to that server you 're gon na find out who 's controlling everything . Call Judge Booth and get his fat , lazy ass out of bed . I want warrants executed on Most Industries and the estate of Karl Schuuster . We 'll take that fucker down tonight . Where are you going ? ( SIRENWAILINGATADISTANCE ) RICKY : Stop ! Come on , slow down . Oh , my God , thank you so much . Thank you for stopping , my car broke down right here . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been stuck here ... I need your car , get out . Now pop the trunk , fool . WALKER : Now give me the cap and walk away . Get out ! ( @tires_screeching ) Sam , now remember when we get inside , you stay with me . And when I say stay with me , you stay close . ( @phone_ringing ) - I 'm gon na take this , guys . - All right . Yeah . Black Escalade , looks like Schuuster 's in for the night . You get those warrants signed ? Got the ADA in there right now , we need more time . Judge is balking at the prelim , says the evidence is too circumstantial . No , it 's because he 's chicken shit . It 's a Beverly Hills address . You tell him to sign that or we 're gon na lose our window of opportunity . - Do it . - All right . ( @tires_screeching ) Now remember , when we get inside , everybody do exactly as I say . MAN : Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , here we go . Everybody get ready . ( TYPINGONCELLPHONE ) ( BEEPS ) ( SIGHS ) I was n't told there 'd be more than one , my rate 's double . That 's not gon na be a problem . ( CLEARSTHROAT ) Okay , let 's go . Make yourself a drink . He 'll be with you in a moment . You stay with me , stay close , all right ? ( @indistinct_chatter ) That 's right , my margin stays the same . No , it does n't change . It 's non-negotiable . 10:00 tomorrow morning , yes or no ? Okay , goodbye . - ( CELLPHONEDISCONNECTS ) - ( SIGHS ) How we doing here tonight ? In the red . Oh , is it a late arrival ? Says she 's gon na charge you extra . Really ? Hang onto this . I 'm gon na try to get my money 's worth . SCHUUSTER : Good evening . You are a vision , Miss ... My friends call me Scarlett . Scarlett , is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wind ? - Oh , yeah . Scarlett , I like that . I 'm sure you will . Really . ( CHUCKLING ) Buy me a drink ? Sure , what would you like ? Always been a big fan of rum . Rum , you are one lucky , young lady . Because me , I got a world-class recipe for mojitos which I got on my last vacation , more or less . And where was that ? That would be Havana . Yeah , see , Germany does n't do it justice . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , you know what the key is ? Tell me . - You wo n't tell anyone else . - Never . You got ta use real sugar cane . And you take some dark rum and you float that , see ? The longer you wait , if you have patience , it 'll put a smile on your face . - I bet it will . - ( CHUCKLES ) - Let me go to work . - Please . Do n't you leave . ( CHUCKLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , it 's got ta be some sort of switch . ( SIGHS ) WALKER : Come on ! Jesus . Hang on to that , just leave it there . - SAM : I got it , Dad . - Go ahead . Come . You follow me and you stay close . ( BEEPING ) Quickly . Look at all this lot . - Focus , Dad . - ( SIGHS ) ( KEYPADCLICKING ) - Here we go . - Thank you . - Cheers to Havana . - Cheers . Mmm . If we need it , now we got it . - I 'm gon na trust they 've got online shit . - ( BEEPS ) Let 's hurry up . Okay . ( @breathing_heavily ) We got a potential breach on the second floor . Get me confirmation . Mmm , you were right . Does put a smile on my face . No , I was talking about me . - You know , if I hang around a little bit . - ( LAUGHING ) Oh , you 're good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moving on to the office . - Hello . - Hi . Excuse me for a moment . Well , okay . Yes , how are you ? Ninety seconds ! So , um , what 's your story ? - ( @glass_shatters ) - Oh , God , I 'm so sorry . Oh , um , let me go get someone to clean this up , okay ? ( CHUCKLES ) Four and a half hours . Well , I was feeling a little tired on that day . Beautiful home you have . - Well , thank you . - You 're welcome . What a beautiful dress you have . Thank you , you like it ? - SCHUUSTER : I 've become a fast worker . - Are you ? ( @both_chuckling ) Looks like I 'm empty . - Yes , yes , you are . - Well , you could give me ... Would you excuse us for a moment ? Sure . ( CHUCKLES ) Saved by the bell . ( SIGHS ) Finally . So how warm is your pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warm enough for us to get in later ? - Sounds like a good idea . - Really ? ( GRUNTING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GASPS ) Sam , hurry up ! We 've got to get some company ! - Come on with me ! Come on ! - ( GASPS ) - ( @breathing_heavily ) - ( BEEPING ) What the fuck is going on ? We 've been breached ! Take this ! Stay here ! - Come here , you bitch ! Stop it ! - ( GROANING ) Dispatch , this is Edward Lincoln 12 , I need immediate back-up at 15715 , Coldwater . Shots fired ! ( @tires_screeching ) WALKER : Sam , we need to move now ! ( GUNSHOTS ) ( @breathing_heavily ) Got it ! ( @engine_starting ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) - ( GROANING ) - Quit it . ( MUFFLEDGROANING ) ( GROANING ) ( MUFFLEDGROANING ) I need that backup in here now ! ( MUFFLEDGROANING ) ( GASPING ) Drop it ! You put that fucking thing down or I swear to Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuck down . - ( GASPS ) You shoot her , there 's no way you can stop them putting a needle in your arm . You and half your fucking department spent the whole day threatening me . Telling me how this guy was gon na come kill me . There he is . That 's not how it 's gon na go down , you know that . Well , I 'll take the gamble . How about you , asshole ? Put it the fuck down . SCHUUSTER : You put that fucking thing down or I swear to Christ I 'll blow her head off . Put it the fuck down ! ( GROANS ) - ( GROANING ) - You shut up ! - Now kick it over . - It 's on the ground . Kick it the fuck over , asshole ! ( GROANS ) Schuuster ! ( GROANING ) ( @footsteps_approaching ) - Dad ! - Get her out of here , go now ! Give me the gun . I was first on the scene . The way I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged by Schuuster 's bodyguards as soon as I got in the complex . Schuuster tried to overpower me . In one last burst , I overcame him and his men . ( @sighs_deeply ) That will be justifiable in the eyes of the law . - ( SIRENWAILINGATADISTANCE ) - It 's gon na work . You better get out of here . Thank you , Detective . ( HELICOPTERBLADESWHIRRING ) ( @siren_wailing ) You know , at that range , you 're lucky the bullet did n't penetrate the vest . Jesus Christ , partner . You think we got enough for a warrant now ? Judge Booth signed off on it the second the call came in . The Lieutenant 's scrambling to cover his ass on this one . Well , he 's always there when you need him , is n't he ? Oh , yeah . ( CELLPHONEVIBRATES ) I 'll leave you to it . ( SNIFFLES ) This is Klein . Detective , listen , mate , this is just a courtesy call . I 'm just checking to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's gon na be a lot of months before we can close the books on this one . It 'd kind of be nice if we had someone that could help us tie everything together . You know what I mean ? Detective , look , after all that we 've been through ... Listen , mate , you 'll sort something out , I know you will . Good luck . Walker ? ( SIGHS ) OFFICER : Mike , I need you to come take a look at this . ( INAUDIBLE ) Listen , I almost forgot , here you go . Ooh , a hundred grand ? Want to count it ? Well , I figured I owed you a little bit more after our big adventure . Um , think I could hitch a ride ? What , on that ? What else do I have to lose ? Well , where 'd you want to go ? I do n't know , where do you want to go ? Why ... Why does everything have to be so difficult ? ( CHUCKLING ) \n",

[Keyboard_clicking] Hey man , what are ya doin ' ? Ah I was laying down , then I remembered Stacey was going to Send me some pictures of Georgia to my email . So I was hoping to check it . If that 's okay with you . Yeah , that 's cool dude . Save some to my desktop as well . Alright , after you 've done that , get your arse out here And have a brew with me . Tommy ! Tommy , where are you ? Yeah , I 'm coming . Shit , settle down . Bloody women , aye . Hey , if you 're not out there in five minutes I 'll have to drink ' em all on me own . Yeah , I 'll be there , let me check my email . Alright . [Door_rattles] [Door_bangs] Derek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had an email from Stacey with some pictures of Georgia ? Was wondering if I could have a look ? Ah , I wish , she has n't sent them yet . Ah , that sucks . Feeling any better ? Not really . Think I might go home and go to sleep . Okay , I understand . C'm on , I 'll take you out the back so Tommy does n't corner You for another drink . That 'd be good . Think he needs a sleep as well . Uh huh . Just give me a sec . Yeah , take your time . [Ominous_music] I first met Ben at the beach when he was doing nippers . Ben is a good looking kid , but on the cheeky side . When I was younger , my dad would beat me If I did n't do what I was told . I warned Ben one day that he would get into trouble If he did n't stop it . Of course , Ben would n't listen to me . Do n't worry dad , I showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colin 's really pissing me off With all his nagging . Derek just stands there and let 's him do it . I had to release some pressure . Derek ? Derek ? You alright , mate ? Sorry , I was off with the fairies . Yeah , you seemed to be . Are you here to see me ? No , I was walking past and had a moment , I guess . What 've you got there , mate ? What , this ? Just book work for the surf shop . Never ends , aye . Speaking of book work , I 've got that sketch for you , If you wan na come in and see it ? Is it okay if I come back through the week ? I 've got a lot on today . Sure , no problem . I can drop it down to the store , if you like . Ah , that 's right , I 'm taking off for a week . We can do it when I get back . You sure ? I can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . No , I do n't have time today . I 've got to run . Look , I 'll call you when I get back . Alright , I 'll talk to you in a week or so , I guess . Here 's one for ya : Did you hear that story about the Fella on the farm that chopped his arm off , And to stop the bleeding , he used a hot iron ? Is that really possible ? If the iron 's super hot , yeah . You could try cauterizing the wound to stop the bleeding . Probably destroy the tissue though . Plus it 'd hurt like hell ! Must have been a brave man . Would n't someone pass out from the pain though ? The human body can withstand so much pain . Most of us will never have to go through what we 're Truly capable of handling . Thank God . Hey doc , I was watching YouTube the other day and I saw this Footage of a dentist in Germany or something ... He was smoking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teeth out , and jeeze it looked brutal . Yes , I 've seen that one . That is without doubt the roughest dental work I 've ever seen . Ah , the guy in the chair was losing so much blood , Surely it would n't have happened like that , Or he could have at least stopped the bleeding ? Well , there are right ways and wrong ways to extract a tooth . Naturally , we use the proper tools to do it . For example , ah let 's see , this one here is designed to get down Inside the gum . And ah this little baby , which just happens to be my favorite , Is designed to pull the tooth out . How about the days where people were tortured though ? They did n't have all this fancy equipment we have today to keep People awake , or alive for that matter . It 's all about conditioning , mate . Conditioning ? What the hell are you talking about , you piss head ? Well , you know how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day you run a \" k . \" Yeah ? Yeah , and if you ran every other day you 'd be able To run further , right ? For sure . Yeah , so torturing someone 's the same . It 's all about conditioning the person 's pain threshold . What they used to do was push you to the limit Where you 'd be about to pass out , then stop . Then come back the next day and push you even further . It 's really a mental tug of war between your brain and the pain . Eventually they 'd pass out , though . Well , how would you wake ' em up if they did pass out ? Its not overly hard , you can get products over the counter to do that . Smelling salts have been around since at least the seventeenth Century to help revive a person that 's passed out . And they work because the ammonia gas irritates the lungs And triggers and inhalation reflex . Which then wakes you up , easy as ! Sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a while . Another beer , mate ? Does a bear shit in the woods ? [Laughs] What , have you been throwing down a few ? Ah , I 'm on me fourth . So , when 's the misses get back ? I du n no . Five , six days , maybe a week . Party time at your place ? Hell yeah , has n't stopped mate . Home brew 's the best . Cheers . So , how you going , mate ? You coping with it all okay ? Yeah , I 'd feel a lot better if they just caught the fucker . Yeah . Are the cops even doing anything ? It just seems like they have no leads at all . Yeah , that 's the problem . They have no clue . I do n't think they 'll ever catch who did this . They said they had no forensic evidence . All they have is some old bastard Who saw someone around three A.M . But detective Harris reckons nothing will come of that Because it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit , that sucks mate . So did the old guy say anything about what he saw ? Only that the guy he saw looked to be late twenties , early Thirties , but nothing will come of it . This bastard will get away with it . Slow down there , turbo , you do n't wan na injure yourself . Mate , I 'll drink you under the table any day of the week . How about you show me this pool room , and I 'll kick your arse . You 're on . Jeeze , strong brews mate ! You alright there ? Yeah I 'm good , just a little dizzy , that 's all . Is that going to be your excuse when I smash ya ? [Laughs] You wish mate . Thud . Glass breaking [Sound_of_screwing_from_drill] **36;5273;TOOLONG You 're okay , just take your time . Tommy , you ca n't move . You 're bolted down to the table . Oh , I 've performed a tracheotomy on you So you ca n't talk either . It 's amazing what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can talk is if I block that hole . I would n't go throwing your head around either . There are pretty sharp spikes pointed at your skull . I reckon it 'd hurt a lot if you hit em ' . **25;5311;TOOLONG Now , what are you trying to say ? [Gargling_stops] What are you doing ? Ah ! Come off it tom , do n't act like you do n't know ! If you tell me the truth right now , I 'll let you go . Truth about what ? I 'm going to give you one more chance to tell me the truth . This is it . If the next words outta ' your mouth are not what I want to hear , well fuck ya then . So you wan na confess ? What have I done ? You know what pisses me off the most About having a pool table ? People always spill crap on them and wreck the felt . Look what you have done , Tommy . You are bleeding on my table . Shit . Well now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... [Tommy_screaming_and_gasping] I did it . You did what ? I killed her . I have your diary , I know exactly what you did to my Daughter , you sick prick . She was six years old . You killed Georgia because you where mad at Colin and me . What the fuck is wrong with you ? And she was n't the only one . You 're a child killer , rapist , pedophile . You 're scum ! Do n't bother Tommy . I cut out your throat So I did n't have to listen to your dribble . How old was Georgia ? She was six . For every year she was alive you 're going to get tortured For a whole day . Six years equals six days . And when I say tortured , I mean I 'm going to cause you so Much fucking pain you 'll wish you were never born ! You are not my brother ! The only thing I wan na hear coming out of your mouth is you Yelling from the pain I 'm causing you . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down for a while . I 'm going to see Colin . You just stay there , and I 'll be back soon . You seem in good spirits today ! Do I ? That week off seems to have done you a world of good . What 'd you get up to ? I rebuilt my pool room . Looks good now . So we 're on for a pool comp soon then ? Hell yeah ! I 'm ordering new felt for the old girl next week . Once I have that , we 'll get into it . So , when 're you coming back to the shop ? Hmm , give me a few more days . I have a few things to finish up . Then I 'm all yours . Good to have you back , mate . Take all the time you need . Now I have a story for you Tommy . I really do n't think you 're going to wan na hear it , But I 'm going to tell you anyway . It 's about that little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shopping centre . Did you ever hear about that little boy ? Ah , it 's a sad story really . This little boy was shopping with his mother . Then the next thing you know , he 's gone . Taken by two ten year old boys . They took him down to the train tracks And did the most horrific things to him . They even cut off his fingers . When I read this , Tommy , after losing Georgia , I really felt for that family . So for the sake of justice I 'm gon na cut off your fingers . One at a time . Hold that thought ! Nearly forgot the wax ! Need to make sure this wax is melted So you do n't bleed everywhere . This will be a lot easier if you do n't move . [Tommy_screaming] Okay , okay ! I 've stopped . I do n't know why you 're upset . I only cut off two of your fingers ! Now the wax is to stop the bleeding ... But it wo n't stick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . [Phone_ringing] Good timing ! Mum 's calling . Mother ! Tommybangingontable , plastic , mufflednoi ... Nah , just waxing some stuff . Yeah sure , what time where you thinking ? Okay cool . See ya then , yeah ... I better finish this waxing . I love you too . Mum and dad are coming to visit . I better get organized . [Tommy_moaning] Do n't worry , I 'll bring you down some food . Ca n't have you starving to death on me . I got a call from that detective the other day . What did he have to say ? It 's been nearly six months . Not too much as usual , apparently some old guy saw Someone around three a , m , walking out of fishers point . Although it was dark , the cops are getting a sketch artist to Draw up a picture of what the old fart saw . ( [Laughs] ) Do n't say that . Hey dad , do you remember That girl that was killed , uh , shit , like twelve years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is that who you mean ? Yeah , that 's the one , what 'd they do to her killer in jail again ? Jeeze son , I ca n't really remember . Hang on , just got ta put my washing in the dryer . Be back in a second . Got ta love clothes dryers . I was just saying that we should get going , Your father wants to watch the footy . I just remembered what they did to that guy in prison . Really ? Hey , Tommy you awake ? I was just chatting with dad upstairs , and He told me what he wants me to do to you for killing Georgia . So tomorrow we 'll do dad 's idea , just to make him happy . You know how he 's always got ta throw his two Bob 's worth in . Righto , well I 'm off to bed . We have a big day tomorrow . What 'd you say ? Just kill me . Oh , I will kill you mate , do n't you worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten fold , Starting tomorrow . Sleep well . Do you want me to leave this or take it out ? ( Softly ) Leave it . I ca n't hear you properly . You want me to twist it a little ? It 's kinda weird , but okay ! ( Laughing ) Aye ? Night bro ! Hey Tommy ! Check this out . Guess where this is going to go . What ? No idea ? Up your arse , mate ! Hey , do n't panic ! I have lube . You do n't think I 'd just ram it up there , do you ? Now your probably wondering why I wan na stick a pipe up your Arse right ? Well that 's where this comes into it . See I 'm going to stick the barbed wire up the pipe and into Your guts . Then I 'm going to remove the tube and leave it up there . You excited ? I am ! I told you we had a big day ahead of us . I enjoyed killing her ... What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry . I hope this fucking hurts , you little prick . Oh , this is sharp shit . I bet you wish I used lube now . Please Derek , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . We seem to be stuck ! I wonder if it 's your guts . Or if it 's the pipe . Hey Colin ! How 's business ? Yeah , things are picking up . What can I do for you ? I 'm just here to see Derek . We have a sketch for him to look at . Ah yeah he mentioned you had a witness or something . He 's not actually in today , he 's got a few days off . Ah , we 'll find him at home then ? Definitely . He 's working on a pool room . Really good for him . Giving him something to do , you know . That 's great . Uh , actually , While we 're here , could you have a look at this sketch ? Sure , anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Thanks for your help . Come on , wake up , Tommy . Oy Tommy , can you hear me ? [Gargling_from_tracheotomy] Oh thank God ! I thought I might have lost you there for a minute . Might have pushed you a bit hard yesterday ... What does n't kill you , right ? Ca n't have you nodding off and missing everything . Screaming , **28;5338;TOOLONG ... Yep , might have to do that in sections , mate . While we wait , how about we read a little ? Recognize this ? There are three stories in here I think we need To seriously discuss , do n't you ? And to save us time I 've highlighted the important parts . Let 's talk about little Ben . He was ten years old , Tommy . What would make any man want to hurt a ten year old boy ? Do you know I 've met Ben 's older sister ? Let me tell you , she is pissed off . She 'd cause you a lot of pain too , but well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need to do it for her . Now you say you broke his knees so he could n't run away . Well , I did some research on knee breaking . And I thought you 'd appreciate this ! I found the plans on Google . The knee splitter . [Sound_of_metal_grinding] So for little Ben and his older sister , I made one just for you . What 's say we try this baby out ? Tommybreathingfaster , plasticrustling **37;5368;TOOLONG ... [Tommy_screaming] Do n't you dare pass out , you coward ! You can handle it ! Ben was ten years old when you smashed his knee caps ! It 's all about conditioning , remember ? You can take it ! You think this is bad ? Wait ' til you see what's coming , this is nothing tom ! I loved you , you were my brother , and all along you were The worst scum of the earth . You fucking disgust me . You still have two days left to pay for what you did . You piece of shit ! Suck it up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , I 'm teaching him a lesson . Uncle Tommy is a bad man . Does it make you feel happy to hurt Uncle Tommy ? No baby , hurting people is bad , But sometimes really bad people deserve to be punished . Daddy , you said when people are bad to call the policeman , and The policeman will put them in jail . I just want Uncle Tommy to never forget What he has put us through , Then daddy will call the police . Promise ? Yes baby , I promise . I love you , daddy . I love you too , baby girl . I come down here to give you a drink And look what you 've done to yourself , Tommy . Seriously Houdini , what 's the plan of attack here ? Shred your last good hand getting loose , then you have to Free your head from those spikes , which is pretty bloody hard even For me , and I made the fucker ! After all that , you have to free your ankles . Then what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of barbed wire Sticking out of your arse ? How the fuck did you get away with murder ? Mmm . That 's right , you did n't . [Coughing] Well I guess this hand 's got ta go ! Please , Derek . Do n't bother ! [Door_bell_rings] Who the hell is that ? Some people have bad timing . Might be around the back ? [Door_bell_rings] Okay , okay , settle down , I 'm comin ' . Ah Michael , how 's things ? Morning Derek , sorry to bother you . Got a few minutes ? Yeah sure , come in . Excuse the mess . Sit down guys , you want a coffee or something ? Ah , no thanks . We wo n't hold you up . We called into the store to see you , but , ah , Colin said you were having a few days off . Yeah that 's right , taking a few more days , Then heading back in next week . So what 's this about , do you have some news for me ? Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop Yesterday to show you this . When Colin saw it , he thought it looked exactly like your Brother Thomas . Detective Harris ! Detective Harris ( Raspy ) [Coughing] I guess it looks like Tommy a little . Wait , you do n't think Tommy 's the guy who did this ? Well , no , but we certainly would like to talk to him . We dropped into his house the other day , but he was n't there . You heard from him at all lately ? [Tommy_crying] Derek , have you heard from him ? Um no , no , um , Tommy does his own thing . Although mum and dad did ask me the other night When they were over if I 'd seen him . I think he went away with his girlfriend . She 's a photographer and had a job out west . I tried to call her but she had no reception . Fair enough . Do you know when they 're getting back ? Saturday or Sunday I believe ? Okay well , I think that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do hear from your brother , Tell him to give me a call . [Choking] Now , let 's talk about kelsie . What 'd she ever do to you ? What was it about her that made you take her out to The bush to rape and kill her ? The part that really gets me is that you had a beautiful Girlfriend and you chose to rape a fifteen year old girl . And to think , sian said she 'd want you in jail . Pedophiles get what ? Couple of years , then they 're let out to do it again ? Not really effective , is it ? Perhaps you 'd like to see what it feels like to be raped ? [Coughing] Pease Derek . Did that hurt ? Did that hurt ? If you do n't answer me , I 'll do it again ! Did that hurt ? ( Raspy ) Yes ! Now you know how kelsie felt ! I see our conditioning is coming along quite well . Might be time to push it up a notch . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his stepfather . Ya ' know how he did it ? He put the phone book on him , like this . Then beat him with a hammer . Now you ca n't tell me that hurt . I think you can take more ! Now that 's got ta hurt ! I bet you 're finding it hard to breathe ! I need a break , Tommy ! This is hard work ! You have a rest . We have a lot to get to In the next 24 hours . Tomorrow we talk about Georgia , but today , Well , today it 's about kelsie . I have a question for you Tommy . You going to tell me the truth ? Water ! Sure , but then you 'll tell me what I wan na know . Deal ? Yes . That 's enough . Now as you can tell , I have a hammer , And this time there is no phone book . You mess me around I 'll crack you with this hammer . Where is kelsie 's body ? Speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We used to play there as kids .

Although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of high school , the final November arrives and leaves as suddenly as a spring storm . Exams , graduation , huge beach parties . Biggie and me , we 're feverish with anticipation . We steel ourselves for a season of pandemonium . But after the initial celebrations , nothing really happens . Somehow our crappy Saturday job at the meatworks becomes full-time . And then Christmas comes and so do the dreaded exam results . The news is not good . A few of our classmates pack their bags for university and shoot through , and suddenly there we are ... Biggie and me , heading to work every morning in the frigid wind in the January of our new lives . Some days I can see me and Biggie out there as old codgers , anchored to the friggin ' place . Beside me , Biggie 's face gets darker and darker . ( HORNSOUNDSDISTANTLY ) When the shift horn sounds , he lurches away , his last canon half-empty . \" Fuck it , \" he says . \" We 're outta here . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wharf . We fill the ancient VW with tinned food and all our camping junk and rack off without telling a soul . I ca n't believe we 've done it . The plan is to call from somewhere the other side of the city , when we 're out of reach . I want to be safe from the guilts . The old girl will crack a sad on me . But Biggie has bigger things to fear . His old man will beat the shit out of him when he finds out . I ca n't tell Biggie this , but missing out on uni really stings . When the results came , I cried my eyes out . I thought about killing myself . Biggie 's results were even worse than mine . He 'd really fried . But he did n't have his heart set on doing well . He could n't give a rat 's ring . In his head , he 's always seen himself at the meatworks or the cannery , until he inherits a salmon netting license from his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the brightest crayon in the box but he 's the most loyal person I know . He 's the real deal . We did n't meet until the second week of high school . I was new in town and right from the start , a kid called Tony Macoli became fixated on me . That 's how it started ... a single decisive act of violence that joined me to Biggie forever . If you believe him on the subject , he acted more out of animal irritation than charity . But I felt like somebody ransomed and set free . Biggie became my mate , my constant companion . Friendship , I suppose , comes at a price . There have been girls I 've disqualified myself from because of Biggie . Not everyone wants to have him tagging along everywhere . Right through high school , I had occasional moments , evenings , encounters with girls , but no real girlfriend , and mostly I do n't regret it . Except for Briony Nevis . For two years , we 're sort of watching each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat-out beautiful . Long , black hair . Glossy skin . Dark eyes . I kiss her once at a party . Well , maybe she kisses me . But there , out of the corner of my eyes , Biggie , alone on the smoky veranda waiting to go home . I do n't go to him straight up . I do make him wait a fair old while . But I do n't go on with Briony Nevis the way I badly want to because I know Biggie will be left behind ... for good . We pull in to fuel up and use the phone . Biggie decides he 's not calling home , so he sits in the VW while I reverse the charges and get an earful . I hang up and find Biggie talking to a chick with a backpack the size of an elephant saddle . She 's tall and not very beautiful with long , shiny brown hair and big knees . She thinks she 's on the coast road north and she 's mortified to discover otherwise . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is n't really even much consultation . We just pull out with this chick in the back . Meg is her name . Meg is as thick as a box of hammers . It 's alarming to see how enthralled Biggie is . And I just drive and try to avoid the rear-view mirror . While I 'm thinking about all of this , Biggie 's gone and climbed over into the back and Meg 's lit up a number and they 're toking away on it with their feet up like I 'm some kind of chauffeur . Biggie 's never had much luck with girls . I should be glad for him . But I 'm totally pissed off . We come upon a maze of salt lakes that blaze silver and pearly in the sun . I begin to have the panicky feeling that the land and this very afternoon might go on forever . ( TRAINCROSSINGSIGNALRINGS ) Biggie 's really enjoying himself back there . I slowly understand why . There 's the obvious thing , of course ... the fact that he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else ... the thing that eats at me ... is the way he 's enjoying being brighter than her , being a step ahead . Feeling somehow senior and secure in himself . It 's me all over . It 's how I am with him . And it 's not pretty . The kombi fills up with smoke again . But this time it 's bitter and metallic and I understand we 're on fire . Without an extinguisher , there 's not much we can do , once we 're standing out there in the litter of our belongings , waiting for the VW to explode . But it just smoulders and hisses awhile as the sun sinks behind us . In the end , with the smoke almost gone and the wiring cooked , it 's obvious we 're not going anywhere . We turn our attention to the sunset . Meg rolls another spliff . We do n't say anything . The sun flattens itself against the salt pan and disappears . The sky goes all acid-blue and there 's just this huge silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't imagine an end to the quiet . The horizon fades . Everything looks impossibly far off . In two hours , I 'll hear Biggie and Meg in his sleeping bag . She 'll cry out like a bird and become so beautiful , so desirable in the total dark that I 'll begin to cry . TIM WINTON AND BOY : In a week , Biggie and Meg will blow me off in Broome and I 'll be on the bus south for a second chance at the exams . TIM WINTON : In a year , Biggie will be dead in a mining accident in the Pilbara and I 'll be reading Robert Louis Stevenson at his funeral . Meg wo n't show . I 'll grow up and have a family of my own and see Briony Nevis , tired and lined in a supermarket queue and wonder what all the fuss was about . All of it unimaginable . Right now , standing with Biggie on the salt lake at sunset , I do n't care what happens beyond this moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets big around us , so big we just give in and ... watch .

Parents had all their savings wrapped up in the market . It collapsed . They got hit hard , lost their house . His dad killed himself . A year later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped from her insurance carrier when she hit stage Ill . Pope flew to Spokane to meet with the insurance adjuster . He pulled a .22 , shot her in her face . Jesus . From there , he went into hiding thanks to Galen Jackson . Jackson 's leader of a small militia group out of Billings , Montana . Anti-establishment radical , gun fanatic , weapons expert . They 're preparing for some kind of attack involving RDX . A very powerful explosive . AMANDA : Okay , I get it . I 'd like to know how you plan to rescue my sister and her boyfriend .

I mean , he smelt , particularly when he took a shit . He just constantly had this drool running down his face . So ... I kind of started fucking with him .

I mean , at the end of the day , he was covered with whatever I threw and I dumped on him , and I would just wheel him outside and just hose him down .

You must be very careful about what things you allow yourself to focus on , lest they become real . Lest the ethereal becomes poor . Lest your fantasy becomes reality . You have to avoid these things . There is Satan waiting to open the door to your heart and walk in . So you have to be very careful about the images you allow yourself to focus on .

You want me to get you in the mood ? Relax , Alex . Forget about everything else . What do you mean , everything else ? What the fuck , Alex ? For all the wrongs we have committed to one another . It is the single act of kindness that God requires of us . You 're looking for a room , sir ? Ca n't do much better . And if you can , I dare you to find it . I wonder , could I ask you a question ? No harm in it . It might sound strange . Do I look familiar to you at all ? Could n't say .

You just leave in the middle of the night ? For , what , a day and a half ? You do n't bother calling me , - nothing ? - Sorry . Oh , my God . It 's fucked up but the only reason why I did n't call the police is because you have been acting so strange lately . Do you understand what I 'm saying to you ? That it did n't faze me that you just left like that . - What are you doing ? - Looking . For what ? Scarlett . Where 'd you go ? Why are you acting like you do n't know me ? Hey .

I looked at them and most of them are perfect . Bright color , firm , good size . But then I found this rotten one in the can . Now , if , say I was dreaming ... I know how that sounds , but let 's just say I was dreaming . Do you really think that my mind would take the time to put a rotten pea in there ? I mean , think about it . When you think about a pea , what do you think of ? A fresh pea , right ? A normal pea . Do n't you ? I really do n't think about peas , Alex . It 's not really you , it 's your subconscious . Do you really think the part of you that dreams is gon na put a rotten pea in a can ? Do n't answer that . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that one bad pea be in there ? I 'm gon na go to bed .

I wake up and I feel like I 'm still in a dream . If you 're ... If you 're dreaming all of this ... - I 'm not dreaming this . - But you just said that . No , no . It 's worse than that . I think someone else is dreaming this . But , Alex , how can we be in someone else 's dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , then she wakes up . Wait . If who dies ? And if she wakes up , then we 're ...

Do you know where you are ? Do you remember this place ? You remember him ? What happened ? Where is he ? Where ? My cousin , he 's ... But who knows ? Maybe it was for the best . I mean , can you imagine the kind of life he would have had ? It was the fire pit , was n't it ? That 's where you put him . And this is your house . This is where you grew up . And the fire pit , you tell me about that . You tell me about when you put him in there . Tell me . Tell me . Tell me ! Tell me ! Tell me ! Tell me ! Do you know what this is ? Is this him ? His bones buried for years in this exact place . Come on , Alex . We both know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip all of this ? No ! I remember . How can that be possible ? How can I remember ? How can I remember the dirt falling in on me ? You dropped him ... Me . ... into the hole . Until there was only my face and my fingertips . And then the rain came , pellets of it . Bullet-sized . Do you remember ? You remember , do n't you ? It filled my lungs and my throat with mud . Even if I was n't paralyzed , there was no fighting against it . There was nothing I could do . Look at me ! I want you to know what happened to me . Do you know what happened to me ? He died , of course . First there was fear . And in those last few seconds , I knew I would die . I felt my body slip away . I saw the world darken . I felt the weight of that mud pressing down on me . And my heart beat so fast until it just collapsed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the one that I 've been waiting for all of this time ? Now pick up the shovel . Pick it up ! Pick up the shovel ! Go on . Just take it . Ca n't you see that you 're nothing anymore ? You 're not Alex . You 're not some hooded man . You 're not the little boy that I killed . - Shut up . - You do n't even exist . You 're only good for one thing , and you know it . So just do it . Just hit me . What ? Just do it . Hit me . - I deserve it . - Shut up . I deserve it . I want it . - I want it , Alex . - No . - Hit me ! - Shut up . No . You know , if you really were him ... If you really were Wayne , I 'd watch you drown 1,000 times . Every night I would beat you and cut you and drag you into another hole . And I 'd watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as earth spills in on you . And you 'd finally understand that this is it . This is it ! And I 'm the one who 's kneeling in front of you , filling your grave with laughter . - Stop it . - And I would say it again and again and again . A man in a hood came and broke in and he threw you into a hole , - and then he raped me . - Shut up . It was so easy . It was so easy and they would all comfort me . And they would make me feel so much better . And they would never know that you could never die - enough for me . - Shut up ! \" I know now I must be accountable for my unspeakable actions . \" And do n't worry , just death comes to all things . \" Flesh , blood , bone ... are all just temporal . \" Rock lasts forever . \" Which is where my spirit will reside . \" I love you .

Rooms are n't sad , Miss Parkins . People are . Come on . So when can you send someone round for the repairs ? Who , Miss Parkins ? Well , we 'll make the best of it . I 'd best be off .

Do you have any photos ? - I know what they look like . - But you must miss them . Will you excuse me ? I 'm sorry . It 's just we all have our ways of coping . This is mine . Well , I 'm sure they 'll come back to you . My husband teases me . Says I 'm the toughest soldier he 's ever met . That he cuts his men more slack than I do my pupils . But our own worst enemy is ourselves . Our fears , doubts . Despair . That 's what 'll destroy us . Good night , Eve . I hope you sleep better tonight . Me too . Come on .

I think you should keep your visions to yourself . Not visions . You 're not listening to me . No , you listen to me . This is not the first body I 've pulled from barbed wire , Miss Parkins . I remember the last war . I 've seen what it can do . You need to be better prepared for this one . There you are , Edward . Come back into the house , please . Wait ! Come back ! Come back ! All right . All right . What is it ? - Sorry . - Do n't be . What happened was terrible , but it was n't your fault . I had the key . A key . There must be others . He could have just found one lying around the house . - Or someone else unlocked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gon na say ? I think there 's somebody else on this island . Living here ? I saw them in the cellar and then by the graveyard . Forget it . It 's just me . I have n't been sleeping well . I 'm just seeing things . Right , come on . Let 's go and take a look . You believe me ? Why should n't I ? Was that you we saw flying over last night ? No . Not my turn . I do n't think I 've seen one of these since I was a boy . I 'm gon na go see if this fits anything . My name is Alice Drablow . Lived at Eel Marsh House my whole life . It is the 19th of October , 18 ... never be believed , I feel the events I am experiencing must be recorded . Perhaps one day ... they will be understood . It all began with the death of Nathaniel . He was no less of a son to me . She may have bore him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were coming home across the causeway . The horse somehow lost its footing . The carriage was thrown into the marsh . She saw it happen from the nursery . He sank so fast . Before I knew it , he was lost . Gone . She blames me . So that I may suffer Nathaniel 's death again and again , she makes me watch so I can see what she saw , - feel what she felt . - ... felt . See what I saw . Get away from me , Jennet . Feel what I felt . I 'm imagining you . You 're not real . So Jennet was Nathaniel 's mother , but Alice brought him up . Until he drowned . That 's what I heard . The carriage falling into the marsh . I must be going mad . No . No , I believe you saw someone , and I believe that something happened here . But we 've looked everywhere on the island . I know where I 've seen these letters before . The village . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you off first . Should n't be long . - What 's wrong ? - The tide 's coming in . - We need to hurry . - It 's fine . No , it 's not ! Slow down ! - Harry ! - Just be quiet ! I need to concentrate . We were shot down over the sea . My crew were trapped in the fuselage as it went under . I could hear them calling to me . I tried to swim back down to them , but ... it was so dark . Could n't breathe properly . - I 'm sure it was n't ... - No , it was . They were my crew . I was the only survivor . So now I do n't like the water . How did you get this ? Tom had it in his pocket the night he died . How did you get it back ? - Get out the way . - James , get off ! Hello ? Hello ? Edward ? Edward ? Mrs . Hogg says you need to come now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward , you 're in so much trouble . Edward ? Edward ? Edward .

You brought her back . Your fault . Your fault . Your fault . Who 'll die next ? It must be you Never needed eyes to hunt . No . My friends had eyes , and so I cried . My friends had eyes , and so they died . Joyce , you 're not meant to be in this room . Joyce ! Your fault ! Your fault ! Harry ! Harry ! Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's go . - What 's happened ? - Quickly ! I tried to tell you the truth , but you were too young to understand . I tried to take you away , but they discovered my plan . Now they wo n't let me near you . They are sending me to an asylum . So I 'm leaving this letter with my solicitor , Mr . Jerome . They can not stop him from giving it to you when you are older . You were brought up thinking Alice Drablow was your mother , - But she is not . \" - But she is not . Your father , Charles Drablow , got me pregnant . This is the truth . Please believe it . I will never let you go . So , please , come to me as soon as you can , for I was , am , and always shall be your mother . - Jennet Humfrye . - \" Jennet Humfrye . \" He died two days later . So he never knew .

Harry will take us to the station and we 'll just leave ... - Enough . - Jean . - I am telling you that we have to ... - Get out ! Go on . You want to ? I do n't want you here a moment longer . No ! I wo n't leave them here . I found Joyce today trying to strangle herself . Do n't you see ? You 're poisoning them . That was Jennet ! Do n't you see ? She 's been seen . We ca n't leave . We need to get the children to the cellar . Now . That 's right , come along . Quick as you can . - Come along . Come along . Girls . - Be careful . Stay away from the glass . Be careful . It 's OK . Nobody deserves to suffer like she did . Why has this got to you ? Eve ? I had a child . A son . I was n't married . I was too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where did you ... ? Where did you ... ? Let me see him , please . I tried looking for him , but ... they would n't tell me where he was . Or his name . After a while , I just gave up . I let him go . Eve . We ca n't let the past pull us under . There 's just too much to do . Too much to live for , right ? She knows . No , this has got nothing to do with her . She told me , \" You let him go . \" That was for Alice . Remember ? She said she blamed her for Nathaniel 's death . Made her watch it over and over again . This has got nothing to do with you . - You 're wrong . - Eve , you need to listen to me . She wants to take something away from me . What ? She wants to turn him against me . - Everybody , stay together . - It 's only a draft . Edward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter 's out of fuel . Miss , I 've found some matches . Oh , good girl .

If I had a dollar for every bad gambler who lost money on my site , and turned around and claimed they got cheated , I would n't need a site . Mr . Block , I ran a multimodal sample distribution at the Plasma Physics Lab at Princeton . These numbers are negative-3 sigma . That means they fall substantially below the standard deviation . I could have gone to the Internet forums , chat rooms , exposed the whole thing , but I did n't . I brought it to you . Well , I appreciate that . Thank you very much . Have a good night . Sir ? Hey . Come on aboard . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , no . I 'm fine . Good . I 'm a big believer in being the person who kills what they eat , you know ? The Indians had that figured out . And not a whole hell of a lot else until the casino racket in the mid ' 80s . Let 's try this part again . My name 's Ivan . Richie Furst . It 's a pleasure , Richie . Welcome aboard . This is The House . I never in a million years thought I 'd have something like this . Just got to the point where me and my old partner , Alex Maynard , looked in the ATM account and realized we had so much money that it was morally incumbent on us to buy something . So , we ordered a set of these boats . We had a good time . A lot of fun . Is he still involved ? No . Alex , um ... You know , this life has a lot of temptation . And it just gets a hold of some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three years ago . He was a good guy . He was my ... He was my best friend . Why The House ? Because the house always wins . Which is why we do n't have to cheat people . We have the greatest business model in the world . 50,000 players , three cents a second , average rake . That 's just poker , okay ? The rest of the site we 're doing $1.2 to $1.9 million a day . That translates into $750,000 net profit per day . But the math is right . Am I missing something ? No , you did n't miss anything . We missed something . We had a couple of our programmers who decided it would be a good idea to write a backdoor into the code so that they could see player 's hole cards . And they cheated you . And they cheated other players . And I 'm really sorry and I 'm embarrassed . And that has nothing to do with what this company and what this site stand for . You saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they 're on airplanes to wherever the fuck donkeys from Compliance come from . But you came to me . You did n't tell anybody else . Because you know rumors of cheating and bullshit can affect these sites like fucking bedbugs and you can never get rid of it . That took a lot of balls . Honestly , I could n't get to you any other way . Regardless , I 'm very grateful . I am nothing if not world-class at showing my gratitude so we have checked you in to one of our company 's executive luxury penthouse suites and your account has been credited with the amount of money that you lost . I do n't know what to say . Thank you . Thank you . Just do me a favor and do n't try to win your tuition online again , okay ? How do you know about that ? How do you think I know ? Studying my player history , ran it through your algorithm , saw that I was playing way above my mean . No , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , Richie , I understand why you did what you did . I know about what happened with that job on Wall Street . You were trying to get rich , and you were trying to be respectable . And you would have , if you had another year and a half . Those people took your labor ... And my fucking money . And your fucking money , and they burned it all up . And now you 're fucked . Because Wall Street 's a different place . The rules have changed . The odds of getting a job at a good hedge fund on Wall Street are roughly the same as hitting runner-runner flush in a hand of Texas Hold ' Em . You probably know what the odds of hitting a runner-runner flush in Texas Hold ' Em are , do n't you ? Roughly four percent . Roughly four percent . Well , listen , I put a little something extra in here for your troubles . That will get you through your Masters . I think that ends our business here . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a shot at a real business . Guaranteed seven figures in the first 18 months . Guaranteed eight figures in the first three years . I have met very few people in my career who I think can be really , really exceptional at this . And you are one of those people . The most important rule in the world is that nobody gives you shit . You want to do something in this fucking life , you go out and build it . What do you say ? Is it Newark , or you stick around here with me ? What do you think ? I think any question that starts with \" Either are you back to Jersey or ' X ' \" , the correct answer is \" X \" . I was in . And I took to it like a gambler 's son . He gave me the full run of the plac . I started right in tuning up the affiliate business . I learned about payment processing , off-shore banking . He even let me bring in my own people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Thirty billion in online gambling and I was there to make sure we got our piece . Three months went by like a weekend in Vegas . Suddenly I have everything I want . Well , almost everything . This is a good one to bet on . His name is Ojo Rojo . Mister Herrera . Paid in total . With dollars , as you wanted What was once paid in full is now only half . Next time bring 500 . Here we go . You might find this hard to believe because of how welcoming my country can be , but some of my colleagues in the legislature believe your kind is ruining Costa Rica . Me doing damage ? I 'm a fountain of money in this shithole . I put millions into your economy . I give employment to hundreds of people , with better salaries than you can pay . I understand , that 's exactly what I tell them . But they go on and on about how the gringos and their online gaming money attracts undesirables , breeds prostitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ? Who knows ? If I give someone 5.7 million dollars in three and a half years , I notice it . And in return , I expect more than advice on a horse . I want stability . Listen to me . You have stability and you know it . We 've been a democracy for over 50 years because we do n't give the people a reason to unseat us . And the people of this country would love nothing more than to haul an American in as the face of corruption . So , that 's why it 's gon na cost you more money . Good luck with the horse . All I had to do was make sure the numbers added up and maybe shave the player edge here or there , 0.8 for blackjack , 0.6 for craps and 3.4 for poker , everybody was happy . Hey . There he is . Ivan . Thanks for having me , man . What do you think ? Uh , crazy . It 's a little over the top , but what are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just ca n't catch a fucking break . What are you crying about ? You dropped three grand . You 'll pick it up later tonight . It 's like they want me to lose . Yeah , that 's why they build casinos . No roll . Shooter , you ca n't slide the dice . No roll ? Fuck you , pay the bet . Sir ? Pay the bet , you fucking greaseball . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey , hey . Take it easy , man . The stickman is just trying to do his job . He fucks up again , he 's gon na have that stick up his ass . Why do n't you let me take over ? Ladies and gentlemen , the point is still eight . Get your hard ways in while the dice are in the middle . Oh , that 's great , Zorro , work the stick . Guess you do n't have the stones to play . How about this ? I 'll fade your action . Just me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How about that ? If this goes bad , I may need some credit . Will 30K cover it ? We 'll call it an advance . Hey , shooter , try to hit that back wall . Believe me , she 'll appreciate it . What shot Jesse James ? A 45 . Centerfield . Press it . All the hard ways . Shooter wants to press it . Shooter , shooter . Six , the hard way . If he does n't roll a seven and crap out , this is gon na cost you 100 grand . The house ca n't sweat the money . Hey , shooter , do me a favor . I 'm thinking of a number . That 's the number . Let 's go . Thanks for playing . You know what ? You forgot the eternal truth . The house always wins . That was pretty impressive . That was pretty lucky . Thanks for backing me . It was business . No thanks needed . This is a single malt . It 's really good . You should try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza and beer guy myself . Baked potato with cheese and baked beans . And look at us now . Look at you . Wow . You really do wear it . Is this how you worked Ivan over ? I did n't work him over . You know , part of my job is getting close to the people who are close to my employer . So , that 's it ? Just checking me out professionally . Pretty much . \" Pretty much . \" Good luck , sir . It 's the casino toss . You know how at the casino when they give you chips they say \" Good luck , sir \" ? They do n't tell you that \" sir \" means \" dummy \" , and \" good luck \" means \" fuck you \" . Holy shit . Those are fucking crocodiles . Yeah . This guy wants me to invest in a crocodile farm for their skin . He sent me these as samples . Ivan ... Mmm ? I appreciate the invite , man . Tonight was a blast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't have fun , I fucking hated it . I do n't know why . It used to be fun . Started out , it was fun . Fuck . Started out , it was the greatest thing in the world . It 's like everything you ever thought you wanted when you were 13 years old . Listen , I got a guy , he 's coming in from London . His name is Brett Sheck . We call him \" Shecky . \" He 's a super affiliate . His players would represent over 10 percent of our business . Okay . Currently , he 's with these pussies at Ultimate Bet . I think you can sign him . If you do , it 's gon na be on for you . Because you 're going to commission everything you bring in . And that 's when the real exponential money starts . And I 'm excited to see you spend it . You up for it ? I 'm on it . All right . Good . You want to throw one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to throw one . I love those little slimy bastards . They remind me of everybody who wants to take a piece out of me . Looks like somebody made a new friend . - Yeah , I did . - Well ... Good . You want me to stay away . No . I want you to do whatever you want . God knows I do . Hmm . You certainly do . Get some rest , yeah ? You called him on cheating you and got yourself a job . I think that deserves a round of applause . What is this ? Who the fuck are you ? If I un-cuff you , you 're not gon na do anything stupid , like run ? Because I 'll shoot you . The FBI is in the kidnapping business now ? I do whatever I want . Man , I 'm in fucking Costa Rica . Look , I wanted to get you alone and I did n't want your boss to see us together . You should be thanking me . My name is Eric Shavers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me \" Agent Shavers . \" And you work for me now . Can we just back up for a fucking second here ? Like I said , you caught him cheating . But what about ... What about bribing an official ? What about racketeering ? What about stealing the player list from his former job to start his new website , Midnight Black ? Now , there 's rumblings that he wants new territories . You are gon na be my guy inside . I do n't know what you think I can do , man . I 'm an independent marketing consultant . Look , do n't play me for stupid ! You 're too smart for that . I 'm too smart for that . You could have worked at any respectable place . Any legitimate casino . Caesars Palace . That 's a nice place . But you chose to sign up with Ivan Block . I 'm not even a principal in the fucking company . I can go wherever I want . You ca n't go to New Jersey . Or any place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . What the fuck have I done in New Jersey , huh ? Or New York , for that matter ? You 're not that bright for a Princeton man . It 's sad . I was talking to my associate , Agent Mohr , and he has a sworn statement from a Dean Monroe that says you were promoting gambling at Princeton . Now , if you were my guy , I could make it all go away . Wipe the slate clean . But if the sun comes up tomorrow and you 're still here , and you 're not my guy then I pull the trigger . And you can forget about working on Wall Street or any legitimate casino . Because you need a license for that , and felons do n't get them . See , I can stand here and say I 'm doing it because it 's my job . Or I 'm upholding the law , blah-blah-fucking-blah . But the truth is , I 'm doing it because I enjoy it . Hmm ? I love fucking over Princeton guys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important . Oh ! Ivan ! I need to talk to you . What 's up ? Fuck , I 'm so fucking terrible at this game , man . They only let me play because I own the team . I just fucking got kidnapped by the FBI . Good . Oh , that 's good ? Oh , I knew they 'd hit on you sometime , I just did n't know what you 'd do . Now I do . Is it that guy Shavers ? Did he give you the line about how I 'm a bad guy , you got ta leave town , all that shit ? Yeah , he 's threatened me with jail . He said I 'd be barred from re-entering the country . Listen , you 're not gon na go to jail , okay ? You got grabbed up by the FBI . I get it . That 's really fucking scary . I was terrified the first time it happened to me . if you want to get on a plane and just get the fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you doing something wrong ? Are we ? I make it possible for a fat guy in Cleveland to play Omaha Hi-Lo in his underwear in his living room . Shoot me . I mean , these fucking shoe companies , they pay a Chinese eight-year-old two nickels to hand-stitch these fucking things till their fingers bleed , then they sell them in the ghetto in the United States for $250 . And I 'm the fucking criminal ? Then why is this guy all over me , huh ? Why is he fucking with me ? Because he 's jealous . He 's , hating on you , that 's why . He sees what you have , he sees what you 're gon na have , and he 's plugging away in a bad suit and heavy shoes for chump change . Look , man , even if it was a crime , there 's nothing they could do about it because they do n't have enough jurisdiction to write us a fucking parking ticket down here . Richie , I look at you , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" look in your eye . You 've been beat up , you 've been knocked down , you 've been kicked around , you 've been told you were n't good enough , and you have something to prove . Now is the time to do it . But let me know . Either way , someone 's got to deal with Shecky . Block is a one man industry , Shecky . He figured out how to take online gambling and make it sexy , with the money and the women . Because that 's the true crave-able experience . Know what I crave ? Name it . Thirty-three percent rake-back on my poker players and cost per acquisition on my casino gamers . We 're at 30 percent and rev-share . Well , I 'm getting my terms at UB and they 're happy to have me , so , I think I 'm gon na stay where I am . Tell you what , give me a day . I 'll talk to him about matching , we 'll lock this thing up . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to get home , my wife and I are about to have our first kid . Ah . Salud . Cheers . Ivan . I spoke with Sheck . Yeah ? A few little things and we 're pagando blackjack . What few little things ? He wants an extra three points rake-back and to stay at cost per acquisition . I know it 's not the original deal , but , uh , we still make a huge profit . No . Fuck him . If we give him that , every piker who thinks he 's an affiliate is gon na want the same thing . No . Then I do n't think we get him . Well , then I guess that 's it , you do n't want the bonus . You know what I mean ? Pack your shit . No , no , no . Ivan , wait . I 've got this . Tell me how much room I have to negotiate . You have no room to negotiate . You already tried negotiating . Now , you try leverage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find out what that is . Then you got ta do the hard thing . That little voice in the back of your head right now ? It 's not your conscience . It 's fear . Hey , man . How you doing ? Thanks for hanging in there , giving me the day . How could I pass up the chance for marlin ? Are we good to go ? Just got to wait for the crew to board . Who 's this guy ? Oh , he drives the boat . Here comes your crew . Permission to come aboard ? God , I love that accent . Permission granted . Come on , girls . Look , man . Eat , drink , fish . Compliments of Ivan Block . He 's not gon na match the UB terms , but we do want you to think of us as friends so , if you ever decide to switch , we 'll be your first call . Have fun . I 'll try . Hi . Well , hi . I 'm a fucking idiot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't blame you , you 're nothing . I 've got everything . I 've got a great wife , a baby on the way , a business . And I 've got to come to Costa Rica and act like an asshole . I 'm sure Block 's gon na press the terms now . No , actually , the terms are the same one's we offered you . Block wants you to feel great about working with us . Question is , where am I gon na be working ? You can still work in London . Yeah , but will my checks be coming from a Costa Rican bank , or Caymans , or Malta , or somewhere else ? I 've heard the whispers . Block 's not too popular around these parts anymore . One of the reasons I was gon na stay away . Player list . My man . You got it ? Got it . You 're a fucking genius . Come here , watch this . Wilson , can you get 30 racks ? 500,000 new international players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 200,000 of these penguins will be betting football on our site . By the weekend , we 'll be doing nine million . We 'll lose some of them , but luckily , we got Shecky out there bringing them back for us , so , we 're gon na be all right . And this is my thanks to you . It 's a little bonus to show how much we appreciate you . You 're a fucking man and you did what you had to do . Spend it all in one place . Knock yourself out . Do some degenerate shit . Do it in my car . Which one ? Whichever one you want . Thanks , Richie . You 're a good man . Richie . Honestly , this is the greatest night of my life , man . I ca n't thank you enough . You do n't look like you 're having any fun . You know , we , uh , ca n't do this . If you like me , what 's the problem ? You know what the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a car . Mmm . Immediately . Get you out of here . Mmm-hmm . I think that 's the best idea . My father described this place as a gambler 's paradise . But to be honest , I never really put too much stock into what my father had to say , ever . Especially about gambling . Well , as a gaming professional , that 's exactly the type of customer I want in the world . You would love him then . But as your friend , I 'm sorry . As my friend ? Let 's just ... No . No , you 're right . Let 's not get too excited , okay ? No , no , no . Too strong . Um , wrong word . \" Colleague . \" Much better . I can work with that . How do you get used to all this ? Well ... There was no \" all this \" when we came here . We built it all , Ivan and I . So , you two were together ? It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put your bags down . No fucking way , man . I 'm getting out of here and you should do the same thing . Come on , man . The three amigos . You got ta stay . What 's up , boys ? Hey , Richie . What a night , huh ? Crazy . Yeah , fun ride , Richie . I 'm out . Out to where ? Out to home . I 'm all the way out . What are you talking about ? Tell him , Pet . Just tell him . Tell me . I 'm leaving my girl 's hotel room this morning when this real hard-ass , Agent **29;6420;TOOLONG , from the FBI , rolls up on me , tells me I 'm breaking U.S . fiduciary ... I got braced , too . Same guy , same speech . You could tell him to kiss your ass . He ca n't touch us down here . He said some scary shit about Block . He 's a government functionary , Pet . That 's what they do . Block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who gives a shit what he says ? He told me I could be barred from re-entering the country if I did n't leave now . So , what are you gon na do , try and re-open your skin ? My brother owns a broker-dealer , he offered me a job . Wall Street ? I 'll be rich , not super-rich . I can deal . What the fuck ? What ? Oh . I hide it in there from the maids . They hate bran . They eat everything else in the kitchen , but they do n't eat the bran . Do me a favor . Invest it for me . I just do n't have time to spend it while I 'm here . I 'm in a basement all day . You should come with . No . I 'm finally in the real shit , optimizing the platform . That 's where the real money 's at . To be honest , super-rich works for me . Richie , I understand the path you 're on . But you should pack it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoss . My future is here . All right , hoss . See you . - Hello . - Young Richie ! I got something I need you to do . It 's gon na be a crash course in client relations . Ivan . Excuse me , Richie . I 'm sorry , what 's the problem ? Send someone else . Why would I do that ? You do n't have any personal feelings in this . Please . Okay , look , here 's what I need you to do . Meet Wilson at the casino . Wilson will give you a k . You are gon na use that key to go to the cage and open box 765 . You are gon na remove the contents of that box . 300 racks . Domestic . I want you to give what 's inside that briefcae to Mr . Herrera . He 's the gaming commissioner , which makes him Caesar in this country . Without him , we ca n't operate . My friend . How are you doing ? Good , how are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug . I want you to meet a magical unicorn . Very rare . Would you like to partake ? I 'm fine , thank you . Okay . Come have a seat . Sit . Sit . Let me show you something . Let 's talk about the ... Right ? It 's something else . First class . Not coach . First class . It 's a very nice gesture . I 'm good to go . Right here ! Mmm ? Is there somebody else coming with the rest of it ? The rest ? The rest . No , that is the entire selection . Well , maybe we have had a misunderstanding . Or perhaps your boss is trying to send me a message . Um ... I 'd be happy to let him know that you 're unhappy . Why do n't I take care of your tab for the evening , huh ? It 'd be my pleasure . Here . You know what ? Thank you . It 's very generous . I will let Ivan know about this misunderstanding . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whores like some fucking congressman ? Tell your puto gringo boss I 'm sending a message . Ivan ! Block ! Did you get in a fight with your kid sister ? Funny guy . Where is he ? Richie , you were just a little too good-looking for this racket . Why did you short him ? I did n't short him . It 's an ongoing negotiation . Then you got more than an ongoing negotiation . You have a fucking problem . Did he take the money ? Yeah , he took it . Then what 's the fucking problem , Richie ? I mean , it 's the gambling business in Costa Rica . Occasionally , you get punched in the face . You let me walk right into it , Ivan . This is your job . You understand ? If you want a safer job , go work for the post office . You want a clear conscience ? Go start a charity . But if you want your own fucking island and your boss says you got ta go out there and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to work and say , \" Do you need me to do it again ? \" Because right now , I am giving you the keys to the kingdom . How did you know I 'd even make it out of there alive ? How did you know ? Because you 're a winner . Because I believe in you . And you got hurt . I 'm sorry . But if I 'm telling the truth , I 'd do it again . What the fuck you looking at ? Did you see this coming ? Six months ago , Herrera would n't have touched anyone I know . And six weeks from now , that could be me . Or it could be you . We 're moving up the timetable . Okay ? When the wrong card hits the board , you can go from a great had to one that ca n't win . And if you 're smart enough , you get out while you ca . Hey , what 's going on ? What is the ... What the fuck ? Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't have any drugs . We 'll see . \" We 'll see \" ? I do n't have any fucking drugs ! I think the lab is going to test positive for Mexican Brown . That 's not fucking mine . Tar heroin . Come on , man . You planted that ! Pasaporte , United States , huh ? You 're not going to need this anymore . Oh , Richie , Richie , Richie . You 're making me look bad . Shavers , look , I believe you . Everything you said about Block is true , okay ? I 'm trying to go home . You ca n't go home now . Now that the fun 's starting . Especially not without your passport . And I know you ca n't go home now that the sergeant has his hands on you . He 's been a bad boy . Now , Richie , this is what I 'm willing to do for you , man . So I 'll talk to the sergeant and have him wipe the slate clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You want me to do that for you , huh ? Sergeant , can you do that ? See that ? Look at that smile on his face . See , that 's the problem , Richie . I keep fucking doing for you , so when are you gon na do for me ? When 's it gon na be my turn ? When 's it going to be our turn ? What are you , the only guy here not on Block 's payroll ? - All right ! - Fuck , man ! Why do n't you just fucking arrest him ? You guys do n't have jurisdictional issues like the FBI ! But if I walk him into a station house or a courtroom , what do you think he 's going to do , huh ? He 's going to buy the judge a steak dinner and I do n't have a job ! All you got to do is help us and all this goes away . Otherwise , you better brush up on your prison Spanish because they do n't take too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , where the hell you been , man ? What the fuck happened to your face ? Nothing . What did you want to show me ? All right . So they got me running these credit card security protocols . And I get in there , into the code , and I decide to freelance around a little bit , right ? So , I find there 's nothing in the individual players ' accounts . What do you mean , \" nothing \" ? Nothing . Practically drained , dude . They keep enough in there to cover the floats . So if any given player wanted to cash out , the software would find the money and then pay him off . In the meantime , Block 's just using everybody else 's funds as his own . Wait . So , what are you saying ? This whole fucking thing is a Ponzi scheme . Hey , Richie ! Block 's upstairs . He wants to see you . All right . Hey . Come on in , Richie . Have a seat . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make poor decisions when they 're desperate . You know what I mean ? No . What do you mean ? Let 's say you 're being charged by a bear . You 're supposed to stand still . Most people run and they end up getting killed . It 's understandable , right ? Let me show you something . I really have Wilson to thank for this . He do n't look like much , but he 's a dog with a bone when he gets an assignment . This is some surveillance footage he dug up . Would you look at that ? Take a few years off him and the old guy really does look like you , does n't he ? This is the Trop in AC . If I was n't your friend , I 'd say your dad was a deadbeat . There is n't a casino , a bookmaker , or shylock from Vegas to New York that the old man is n't into for some serious wood . You owe money like that , you get a reputation . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully we can get him some help . And get you some help , too . This is my favorite part , right here . Look at this . That is n't just card counting , that 's passing a bobo . Turns out , the old man 's been kiting counterfeit bills from Tunica to Nevada . They were about to arrest him before I grabbed him up . In fact , I have him over at the Intercontinental Hotel , just down the street . Here 's the thing , Richie . Your dad owes $187,000 to some guys that do n't fuck around . But you 're my man , and you took some hits for me . And I do n't forget that . So this is what I did . I bought the debt . I own the paper on your father . The only person who can do anything to him now is me . Which is good news , because I would never do anything like that . I hold the debt , your dad stays healthy , and we can all go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you . I appreciate it . Richie ? Uh , come in . Sit . See this ? What do you think ? This is where they put me . It 's a real soft spot , huh ? It 's real nice , Dad . Yeah , it reminds me of that suite we were comped in Atlantic City once when you were a kid . Are you talking about the time you left me all alone in the hotel room while you were at the casino ? Look , Rich , you know , I wish I had a time machine , I 'd go back and I 'd fix everything , but I do n't . We 're here now . And where do you think \" here \" is ? Huh ? Paradise ? Well , you know , it kind of looks that way to me . Let 's go out on the balcony . Check out the view . Look , I know where I am , all right ? And I knew exactly what was happening the minute my debt got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Been around gambling all my life , and that would be a miracle . And miracles do n't happen . So you know Block owns the debt . Yeah . And I know that 's worse than any wise guys walking the boardwalk because it is n't just me that he 's got under his hammer . Yeah , I know . Apparently this shit runs in the family . It does n't have to . I just do n't want to see you making the same mistakes I made . Going after this bullshit . Chasing the action . Come on , do n't let them use me to keep you here . Go . Run . Run , for Christ 's sake . Just run . Go back . Go back to school . I mean ... I 've been a dead man walking for the last 15 years . Dad , try and sit tight . I 'll figure a way to get us both out of this . No , no , no . Come on . After all these years , you 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your mother talking . She raised you right , I guess . Payoffs are how the casino business in Costa Rica works . It 's why this government does n't shut Block down . But now it 's time for me to buy some goodwill of my own . Yeah ? Agent Shavers was right about everything . We should have left . Shavers ? You said he did n't even approach you . Listen , after the players ' accounts , I found something else . It 's a way bigger scam than I thought . We 're screwed , man . Cronin , slow the fuck down . What are you trying to tell me ? Just come see me . I got ta show you in person . Hey , Richie . Where you going , babe ? Going home . Yeah ? Why do n't you do that later ? Come take a ride with me . Wilson . Where are we going ? Do n't worry about it . Enjoy the ride , man . So neither of you guys are gon na tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat . Come on . Richie ! How you doing , bud ? Fellas . Hey . Richie , remember , um , that whole thing I was telling you about the Indians ? Not the casino thing , but the respecting what you kill . Or whatever that hokum shit was . All right , here 's the deal with this . The over-under is 90 seconds . Bet is $10,000 . Do I pay you guys enough to jump in on 10 grand ? Yeah , I take the over . How 's that ? What the fuck you talking about ? It 's so fucking dark , it 's gon na be two minutes before they even get the fucking scent . I brought two idiots to Latin America , Richie . It 's like sand to the beach , but what are you gon na do ? What the fuck is this ? This is where the Rio Tarcoles lets out . Ivan ... Your problem is with me , let him go . Hey , Herrera , if you had n't acted like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . So do n't try to be noble . Basically , this place is to crocodiles what Goldman Sachs is to pricks with skinny ties . There 's just a fucking ton of them . Cruise ships come down here , they dump off their edible waste , the crocs have learned to swim downriver and they know to bite whatever jumps in the water . This shit is chicken fat . I do n't know why , but for some reason these fuckers really like poultry . All right , go ahead . All right , ready ? Ready to fire it up ? Wilson , keep the clock . Here we go . One , two ... Fucking Christ , Ivan ! Swim ! What do you want ? ! You scared the shit out of them . Can we fucking pull them back in ? Hold on . Shh , shh . Do you hear them ? I 'm fucking talking to you , motherfucker ! Ivan ! We got fucking money on this , dude . Chill . You 've scared the shit out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? What the fuck is wrong with you ? Dude ... I 'm doing this for you , man . 80 seconds . Would you just pull them in ? What do you need ? 10 dimes . 90 seconds . Jesus Christ ! Fucking bullshit local legend , I guess . Give me the fucking thing . All right , calm down . Fuck me . It 's just a little fun , that 's all . Come here . Hey , come here ! Oh , shit ! Now they fucking come ! Do something ! I got it . Are you all right ? I 'm not getting them out . You get them out . Pull them in . Holy fuck , man . Come on . Let 's go . What are the odds ? I was kidding around . I did n't really think crocodiles would come . We just got lucky , I guess . Are you all right , Richie ? You seem a little worked up , a little sweaty . Is it the hot night or ... Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Terrific . All right , clean them up . Let 's get them out of here . Good luck . Hey , how did that horse do ? Ojo Rojo . I 'm fucking with you . I know this is n't a good time . All right , let 's go . Let 's go . See you soon , Richie . Cronin ? Andrew ? Cronin . Fuck , man . What 's happened ? Did Block send you ? No , he did n't send me . Something 's happened to Cronin . He was cooperating with the Feds . But you knew that already , did n't you ? I did n't . Bullshit . Let me ask you a question . When I talk to you , am I talking to Block ? Not anymore . I wish I could believe that . You can . You can trust ... No , I ca n't trust you . I did trust you ! I did n't know that he was going to use you . Stop fucking lying to me ! Ivan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're moving to Antigua . And ? And he 's looking to hang things on someone . A mark . Me . And when he 's gone , all of those people that we 've crossed , they 're gon na come looking for you . How long have you known this ? I started wondering after two years . By the third year , when we left the Caymans , I knew for sure that he was stealing . But by that point I was too far in . I 'd signed a contract , there was a paper trail . That 's what Ivan does to you . He figures out exactly what you want and he gives it to you . I 'm sorry . I hope so . Because what I have to do to get out of this , I ca n't do it alone . The payoff merry-go-round has to keep spinning . And I need operating cash to buy my way out . So it 's less for them and more for me . I 'm just hoping I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta love this country . Yesterday you wanted to kill me and today we 're like brothers . We are not fucking brothers . I need to talk to Herrera . He 's gone , he left the country early this morning . Then we need to talk . Esteban ? Esteban ! Where is he ? I put together a savings account for this guEl Capitan . Yeah , that 's his real name . Is this gon na work ? I guess we 'll see . Where the fuck is Cronin ? You tell me . I thought he was working for you guys . You do n't understand cooperation , do you ? You 're supposed to keep me posted on Block . Circumstances have changed . What 's changed ? Block has my father . Well , if you had told us , we could have kept him safe . But you did n't . So where the hell is Cronin ? I 'm on the phone with him and the next thing I know he fucking disappears ! Shit . You know what ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You beat the shit out of me ! You say you can protect me , protect my father . You ca n't even protect the only source you had ! Fuck both of you . I 'm done . You 're going to fucking help us ! You understand me ? I 'm not doing shit ! You want to arrest me ? Fucking arrest me ! I 'll fucking kill you ! I do n't give a shit ! All right , let him up ! We went about this all wrong . I 'm sorry , are you okay ? I 'm sorry . But I do n't have time to fucking play with you . Take a picture with me . Happy smile , gringo . Here we go . Good . Now you have forty-eight hours to get me what I need on Block . A piece of evidence that will hold up in court . If you do n't , he gets that picture and your life goes to shit . Let 's go . Come on , Cronin , what the fuck did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Layers and layers of financial crimes . Block using player accounts as his own piggy bank . Laundering money and , of course , Block 's contingency plan . Me . Oh , my God . There 's enough evidence on here to put Block or me away for a long time . Have you been booking travel ? I have . I put everything I have into it . Planes are n't cheap . Thank you . Block has been siphoning the player account money and directly routing it to bank accounts with my name on them . But when this goes public it 's going to look like I own them . All the bank account info , the missing money , everything . Ivan 's told me to pack . We leave in 48 hours . Everything 's ready in Antigua . You know I 'm with you . New love . What are you doing ? Uh , you know , I was just leaving . I was gon na go make the rounds . One last payoff toEl Capitan . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one play left . Push all my chips in and hope to get lucky . Did you bring something for me ? I am a man of my word . Very good . I 'm also a man of my word . Hey , where you going ? You know , for being such a smart kid , you make some dumb fucking moves , you know that ? You do n't think I know who that guy is ? Where he works , what he does ? Hmm ? You do n't think I know what you 're trying to do ? You 're done , Richie . I think you should just walk outside and get in my car . There 's got ta be some kind of deal you and I can make . Thank you , Richie , but I 'm well taken care of . I think you should stop embarrassing yourself , walk outside , and get in the mother_fucking car , man . You do n't think I 'm taken care of , too ? Richie Furst . Shavers . We found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank God . Where are you ? Are you bringing me evidence ? No . I 'm bringing you something better . Block timed it perfectly . He 's out the door by the time the bribes stopped and the police took everything down . Yeah ? Hey , Richie . Where are you ? At the office . Ivan , what the hell is going on ? The site 's been frozen . Listen , Richie , you 're about to get arrested , okay ? I 'd love to tell you that I was gon na come down to the police station and bail you out but we both know that 's not true . Sorry it worked out this way . I like you , you 're a good kid . But it is what it is . Sorry , pal . By . You all right ? Yeah , set . You 'll find another boyfriend when we land at the next stop . Younger and dumber next time . Dumber wo n't be easy . Where the fuck is Wilson ? I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fend for himself . Do you mind ? Sun . I love new beginnings . Any new industry , the first 10 years , it 's like Russia after Communism . It 's all strength and will . And now , it 's time for a little nuance and finesse . Every player has a leak in his game . Even Block . All you have to do is find it . You really saw me coming , did n't you ? The cars , the boats , the money , everything . You handpicked me , and you slow-played it perfectly . What did you expect me to do , Richie ? Walk into my party , accuse me of cheating in front of all my friends . I ca n't let that go by . That 's the problem with your generation . You guys sat around with your vintage T-shirts and your participation medals and you never did anything . And you got too big and too greedy . Okay . What are you gon na do about it ? You do n't think I own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is ? Bienvenidos a Puerto RicoIvan ! Territory of the United States of America . The Captain , a man of his word . I knew deep down you were just homesick . You know what your biggest problem is , Ivan ? You talk and you talk , but you do n't actually hear yourself . Well , I did . And you 're just like every other gambler who comes onto your site . You press it , when you should have folded and moved on . Later on , when you 're in prison , that voice you 'll be hearing in your head is n't your conscience , it 's fear . Ivan Block , you 're under arrest , my friend . How 's it going , fellas ? Better than you . Money laundering , racketeering , wire fraud . Look under your feet . That 's American concrete . Kiss it , because you 'll be sleeping on it for a long time . We 'll see . That 's the great thing about America , we go soft on financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Maybe I 'll see you around , Richie . Good luck , sir . Get this piece of shit in the car . What about him ? Him ? He 's a cooperator . Yeah , do n't worry about him . Think about him banging your girl while you 're in jail . Now , here 's the good part . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to an attorney . If you can not afford an attorney , a really fucked-up one will be provided for you . Listen , I want you to get Richie Furst . I want to start this debriefing ASAP . You do n't think he 's on that plane ? You got to be kidding me . Go with the ground crew ! Hey ! Somebody stop that plane ! We had a deal ! Shit ! Agent Shavers ? Yeah ? I have something for you . Thank you . He 's a free man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jersey , or ... I 've never even been on a private plane before today . You get used to it pretty quickly . Maybe I already have . \n",

Once the Bellagio put Bill Gates out of the high-roller 's suite because Liyuan was flying in . He is the perfect Vic . But how did you know who he was gon na pick ? We told him to . We been telling him all day . From the moment he left his hotel room , we 've been priming him . Programming his subconscious . He 's been seeing the number 55 all day bong . On the elevator . In the lobby . Even the stick pin on the doorman . Not only that , we loaded his route from the hotel to the stadium . He looks out the window , primers are everywhere . Now , he does n't see it , but he does . There 's no getting around it . He even sees Farhad . I 'm trying to drive , you Rhino bitch ! Fuck the Rhinos ! Fuck the Rhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vase to the tramp stamp on the hooker we sent to his room last night . That is genius . Yeah . And it 's not only what he sees . It 's what he hears . The Mandarin word for \" five \" is woo . There are 124 \" woo-woos \" in \" Sympathy for the Devil . \" Now , he 's not registering it , but it 's all there . So when he picks up those binoculars , looks out on the field sees a familiar face with the number 55 on his jersey some little voice in the back of his mind says : \" That 's it . \" And he thinks it 's intuition . And he picks . Do you want me to write it down ? And you , being in the dark , was the convincer . We call that the \" Little Blind Mouse . \" I 'm the \" Blind Mouse \" ? You 're such an asshole . You ca n't tell me that 's 100-percent real . Well , it 's probabilistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than Vegas . And what if he picked wrong ? Double it till it happens . That 's amazing . You 're amazing . Nicky ! What 's wrong ? You did great . Okay . What 's going on ? Why are we pulling over ? Nicky ? What is this ? It 's 80 . The job is over . You did great .

What 's going on ? Answer me ! Nicky ! Shit . I was n't expecting such a kind face . The tech says his gizmo checks out . But in all candor , I do n't like this . And I do n't like him . Why ? He 's a con man , sir . That 's the point . I keep my Beretta well-fed . Owens . Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are a man known for great skills of persuasion and deception . You were very hard for me to find . - Why did you take my offer ? - Went broke . My car . Forty million euro in RD , easily . McEwen , Rahal , Lotus ... Any team in any class , they spend half of that . But I have something none of them have . - A fuel-burn algorithm . - Yes . The EXR . They all want it . It 's legal . And my engineers promise it guarantees me a win . That 's not enough for me . This year McEwen is the only team standing in my way . That is why I wanted you . - So ... - This needs to be discreet . It needs to be safe . No holes . I will pose as a disgruntled team engineer of yours offering to sell the EXR to McEwen . What I will give him is a fake . It does n't really do anything , just gives false readings to their instruments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight added edge . A third of a second every few laps . Imperceptible . Just because the techs say that it checks out what makes you think you can convince them that you 're absolutely real ? That you 're ... That you 're totally authentic ? You ca n't be clicking around here , boy . You do n't need to worry about me . I 'm extremely well researched . We 'll proceed as planned , starting at the kickoff party tonight . - Okay . - I 'll be seen drinking and boisterous and disgruntled . I will approach you in full view of McEwen . An argument will ensue , I will throw my drink I will shove you , if that 's okay with you ? It 's okay . I 'd be very surprised if McEwen did n't approach me right there but if not , I will contact him . - Good . Whatever he 's willing to pay me , I will be keeping 100 percent for myself on top of the 1 million from you . - Do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a deal . That 's great . Appreciate your time . I 'll see you tonight . - Thank you . Do n't say I did n't warn you . Drama . I 'm excited . That 's right . Do you speak English ? Yes , absolutely . Yeah , but you speak good Spanish . Oh , yes . Oh , why , thank you , thank you . Um ... Look , I 'm here tonight for business . And I am a recovering alcoholic . So when I ask you for a vodka martini on the rocks if you could give me water with olives that would be fantastic . - Great decision , sir . Wise . - Thank you .

Town 's lousy with them . - Can we get back to business ? Please . - She 's a little small on lop for my taste . One man 's small is another man 's perfection . It 's like a \" breasts are a subjective opinion \" topic . Maybe if you 're booking a fashion show . I 'm talking about fucking slapping balls , mate . Do you want the thing or not ? I 'm gon na need to see proof . I 'll contact you . - A Spritz , por favor . - Okay . And a vodka and cranberry , please . Hey , you need to put some clothes on . Excuse me ?

What does that mean ? - Oh , dear God . - I 'm just saying . Please , never make that face again . I do n't even wan na know what that means . - Oh , I think we do . Heh-heh . - I think we do n't . Everybody knows you 're a lesbian . It 's completely fine . - Who knows I 'm a lesbian ? - It 's especially fine to me . - Where are you getting this from ? - Every other time you speak , I smell a vagina . - It 's not true . - That 's not a bad thing , believe me . Oh , Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nuts . - I do ? Good . - Yeah . I 've never seen him like this . You know , he 's barely worked since New Orleans . Seriously ? I know he 's an asshole . I mean , a really big asshole . - Yeah . - He should 've handled it better . But he 's my friend , and I 'm gon na bat for him . So can you give him a break ? I do n't care what Nicky told you . I 'm not falling for this shit . I do n't think you got that right . He seems different now , and I 've known him a longtime . How do I know that ? What is that ? It 's an orange .

I go straight every time I 'm on parole . - Oh . - Now drink a cup of concrete . Man up . \" - Solid advice . - Yes . - Mm . - Heh-heh . How 's that working out ? Well , thought I was ready to work . Then the girl walked in . Why are you going to all this trouble , Nicky ? What do you want from me ? I can convince anyone of anything . I once convinced a man that an empty warehouse was the Federal Reserve . - So I 'm good . - Yeah . You 're the best . But what I really want is to tell you that I 've changed . And tell you that I am sorry . And I just want you to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to believe you . I 'm different now . I have to be getting back . I ca n't do this . I 'm sorry . You all right ? - What happened ? - I do n't wan na talk about it . - Did he do something to you ? - No . Jess , did he put his hands on you ? - Tell me what happened . - Just ... Just kiss me . I have to leave soon . I want you to come with me . I know you think you love him . But I want you to come with me tonight . I do n't love him . I just ... But I ... But you ca n't trust me .

Uh ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn , you should 've ... All right , uh , give me a sec . We 're good , just ... Ugh . I 'll get rid of him . Hey . You 're still sleeping ? I thought you were meeting with McEwen . I am . Later . There 's a lazy Sunday softness to your generation . Makes me uncomfortable . I like to be on my feet . I 'll lie down when I get cancer . Or if I fuck . Both of which will be done on my back , in case you were wondering . Um , no , actually , I was n't wondering . But thank you for sharing that . Sarcasm . Another pillar of your generation . You wan na tell somebody to fuck off , tell them to fuck off . Do n't say , \" Gee , what a great jacket . \" It 's weakness . That is a messy bed . Yeah , I do n't sleep well . - Someone here , son ? - Who you calling \" son \" ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , tell me . You with your iPhones and your smartphones and your laptops and computers . All of which produce nothing but a barrage of useless information . Fucking Twitter . As if anyone actually cares that you 're eating a turkey sandwich for lunch . Sorry . Panini . - Sarcasm ? - Satire . Fucking panini . Look , um , are we done ' ? You might be . Who 'd you pick up at the airport ? - Garriga has you fucking following me ? - I got people there . - My computer guy . - Why ? Is there a problem ? There wo n't be because he 's fucking here . I got a little red hair on my taint that tickles when somethings afoot . And lately I 've been scratching my nethers like a fucking macaque . Okay . Look , there 's no reason for anybody to panic and start getting bent out of shape because we 're getting to the end . Nice day . Nicky . How the fuck did you do ... ? Back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong . Enough of the pleasantries . Hey , nice jacket . Fuck off . It 's real . Gordon ! Gordon ! Fucking you , mate . You 're my new fucking favorite person , fella . I swear you 're fucking 6 inches fucking taller and twice as fucking handsome since you walked in here . There you go , son . - Lap it up . - My pleasure , Mr . McEwen . - I wish you the best of luck . - Friends like you , who needs luck ? Now fuck off . Ha-ha . - Yes ? - Mr . Garriga . - How did it go ? - It 's done . - Good . - I wish you the best of luck . With friends like you , who needs luck ? Jess , letting you know , uh , I left a key for you at the desk . See you at 7 . Wish you the best of luck . With friends like you , who needs luck ? - I wish you the best of luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you the best of luck . With friends like you , who needs luck ? - Wish you the best of luck . - With friends like you , who needs luck ? - Best of luck . - Friends like you , who needs luck ? Friends like you , who needs luck . Friends like you , who needs luck , huh ? Jess . Fuck . Sorry I 'm late . What ? Nothing . Let 's go . Do you really think I 'm such an amateur that I would not have someone with McEwen ? Someone to keep eyes on you ? Hm ? Twenty years in this business teach you never to be too careful . He is my secret weapon . Now , heh , imagine my surprise when Gordon showed me what you sold to McEwen . Not some fake softwares , as we discussed but my plans , my designs . The real EXR ! Stolen from my sewers , stolen from me ! What 's more , you sold it to McEwen for 3 million euros . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which means you sold it to everyone ! This is my reputation . This is my standing . You 've made me look like an amateur . Ah , that 's what you get when you hire a con man . Thieving piece of shit . How did you get the information ? Hm ? And what did she have to do with it ? All right . Nothing . All right ? Listen ... - Tell me . Hm ? - Hey ... Hm ? Tell me ! Leave her the fuck alone ! I 'll tell you ! I have a guy . He cracked your encryption . He found a back door into your server . It was actually pretty easy . You should probably fire your IT guy . No ! You used my login . My password . - Computer tries every possible combination . - Bullshit ! This generates a new password every 15 minutes . It never leaves my sight . - How did you get it ? - Who the fuck cares , man ? It 's done . Okay . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let her go ! - How , how , how ? - Let her go ! - How ? - All right . It was her ! It was her . All right ? It was her ! It was her . It was her . But she did n't know . She did n't know anything . Okay . Your security was tight . It was tighter than I expected . I thought I could break the key , but I could n't . Then I saw Jess at the party . And when I found out that the two of you were together I knew she was my in . So I used her . And I 've been using her . You see , there 's a science to getting people to trust you . With women , it 's all about emotion . Connection . That you feel the emotion as strongly as they do . They 've been dreaming about that shit ever since they were little girls . With her , it was shared history . A friendly face . Set her off balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight ! Start discussing emotional shit . They 're disarmed . Now they 're open . You know you got them when they start to unconsciously mimic you . A head nod . A hand gesture , it means you 're in sync . Sociologists refer to it as the Gauchais Reaction . And then you move in for the kill . You tell them how they 've changed you . I 'm different , Jess . Changed how you see the world . Then you close . A talisman . A gift that says : You 've always been in my thoughts . The necklace had a wireless keylogger in it . All I needed was for her to enter your room . And when she did that , I had what I needed . Picked up on your keystrokes . I logged in to your computer as you and downloaded everything about the EXR . I 'm sorry . But it was not her fault . She had no idea . She got fooled . So why do n't we let her go ? And me and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's lost his mind . What 's funny ? More bullshit . What is so funny ? More lies . What the fuck is so funny ? What 's so funny ? Garriga 's not my boyfriend . - What ? - I hardly even know him . She 's just a race skank . What 's a race skank ? - But I saw you ... - No . You saw what I wanted you to see . You taught me that , remember ? She 's been driving me crazy . Hanging around , flirting , teasing . The minute I try to get her up to my room : - But I have a headache . - Cramps . That time of the month . It 's like a crime scene . I have Scrabble in my room . A headache . A period . Right ? The world 's longest period . She 's never even been in my room . - What ? - We 're so screwed . What the fuck ? I was trying to ... What the fuck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - This watch ? - You 're not still doing watches . It 's a Piaget Emperador . It 's worth 200 grand . I 'd been on him for a week . I was waiting for my chance . And then you showed up . - You are so much better than watches , Jess . - It 's what I am good at and I like it . Okay , no , no , no . When you came to my hotel , he had roughed you up . No . He had roughed me up . She was stealing from him . He caught me charging Garriga 's credit line ... - ... and scared the shit out of me . - This is really fucking unbelievable . You did all of this to make me jealous ? No . Some of it was payback for New Orleans , but ... Yeah , to make you jealous . I can not believe you lied to me . - You ca n't believe I lied ? - Ca n't believe it . - You ca n't believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , that 's so rich from you . So rich . - That 's what you wan na say to me ? - Yeah , because there 's always a job . - Be sure . I just tried to save your life . By lying ! Because you 're always lying , Nicky ! I do n't know when you 're telling the truth . And now we 're dead . Fuck . She 's right . You 're right . Heh . Here 's the thing about lying . Here 's the problem : Fucks up all your options . Paints you into a corner . What the fuck you talking about ? You out of your mind ? And then you 're forced to do some really dumb shit . - You wan na die ? - Well , if I die , I wan na die telling the truth . And if I lie , I wan na lie like normal people lie . I want my wife to say , \" Hey , honey . Do I look fat in these jeans ? \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You look terrific . You should wear those . \" That 's how I wan na lie . But this ... If I 'm done I 'm gon na tell the truth . So , Mr . Garriga , I 'm gon na tell you the truth . And you are not gon na like it at all . About a year ago , I pick up the phone ... - What the fuck are you doing ? - Nicky ? I could n't take another fucking word . You 're next , honey . - No ! Are you crazy ? - Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . What the hell were you thinking ? Huh ? Fuck you . Now s0mebody 's hurt . You know what ? I have nothing to do with this . Look at me . Look at me . It 's okay . This is your mess . You clean it up . And keep me out of it . I do n't know what to do . Please ... Please , please , stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , no . No . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . It 's fine . Nicky , look at me . Look at my eyes . I love you , okay ? I love you . Please . Please , do n't do this . Please . Please . I trust you . You can not leave me again . Please , do not leave me again . Please . What the fuck ? You want him to fucking die ? What kind of a piker are you , for chrissakes ? Oh , shit ! Did n't he tell you I was on the inside ? Jesus . You must be terrified . It 's gon na be okay . He is not gon na die . Do you hear me ? He is not gon na die . Probably . You see , you shoot between the third and the fourth rib just about eleven o'clock off the left nipple . Here . - Hold pressure on that . Hold pressure on that . - Okay . That misses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , puncture the lung . Let me in . There we go . Is this Toledo Panic Button ? Oh , maybe you 're not such a piker after all . Left untreated , you got about 10 minutes before you drown in your own blood . But you patch it up ... - ... you account for the cavity pressure . - Oh . - Agh . - Oh , God . And then ... There we are . There we go . There we go . - There 's my boy . - Ah ! - Oh , Jesus . - There 's my boy . - Ah . Agh ! - Are you okay ? - Oh , Jesus . - Here . Hold on to that . Hold on to that . Keep your eye on that . If he ca n't breathe , you pull the plunger again . - Okay ? - Okay . Good Lord , I can not believe that you made me shoot you . And then for what ? So that you can make cow eyes at some race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I 'm not a race skank ! You die with the lie , Mellow and you still just might . - Fuck you . Do n't call me \" Mellow . \" Jesus Christ . You 're his dad ? In the loosest fucking possible terms . I 'm Bucky , by the way . You know , I like you , honey . You can take a punch . Ha-ha . - God . - And there it is . Tell you what , you steal us a car , and I 'll gather up the money . I ca n't steal a car . I 've been working for this prick Spaniard for three years and he 's got a guy at McEwen and does n't tell me ? What the hell ever happened to trust ? Are we almost there ? I bust my ass to get you that EXR crap and ... Agh . And then the girl walked in . Do n't be an asshole . That any way to talk to your father ? You 're not my father . You walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trade , I taught you my passion . Three generations of skills . Ah . And in spite of all my earnest efforts , in spite of all my hard work you turned into a good person . Well , I just ... Ah . Go figure . And I left you on the street for a good goddamn reason . - Because I was soft . - Oh , that just shows what you Know you dumb son of a bitch . We had a good thing going . And then one day like seven years in , we 're running this poker deal in Boston and a guy pulled a gun . Fucking gun . Glock . First time I 'd ever seen one . And I 'm just paralyzed . Heh . And all I could think about was the kid . That night I walked . I never looked back . Love 'll get you killed in this racket . No place for that shit here . No happiness with that .

      "@@7017640 This story begins in a secret place hidden deep in a forest . That is a Smurf . We call him Clumsy . And this is our village , where there 's a Smurf for just about everything . Like Jokey . Hey , here 's a present for you . Gullible Smurf , you 're so gullible . Actually , I meant to give you this one . Thanks ! - 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 . - Here 's Hefty . And over here is ... Now , for the one-fingered pushup . One , two , three ... Meet Nerdy Smurf . - Excuse me ? - Sorry , Brainy . Just kidding . Nosey . Well , what 's going on over there ? Paranoid Smurf . Winner . Loser . Karate Smurf . Handy . Vanity . Farmer . Painter . Baker . Magician . Scuba . Policeman . Therapist . Sometimes I just feel blue . There 's even Table-Eating Smurf . Hi . Yeah , we 're not too sure about him , either . And then there 's me , Papa Smurf . I sort of run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Or Clumsy . Or any of them . It 's about the only girl in our village . Smurfette . Hi , Laundry Smurf . - Howdy-do , Smurfette . - Hey , guys . But that 's not the only thing that 's different about Smurfette . She was created by the evil wizard , Gargamel . Using dark magic , he made her from a lump of clay . Now , go and find Smurf Village . Luckily , I knew a little magic of my own . But there was still one problem . Smurfette 's name does n't tell us anything about her . Okay , the physics are ... It does n't tell us who she is . - High heels . - Or what she does . So , what exactly is a Smurfette ? Well , let me be frank . She 's a rubbish baker . Let 's see . Smurfette . Smurfette , Smurfette , Smurfette . It 's not here . Well , Smurfette is a combination of a Smurf and an Ette . But what 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... She 's the greatest . The most wondrous creature on Earth . Yes , you are . Smurfette ... I got it . This is one of those eternal questions that we 'll never , ever know the answer to . Wait , she is ? Do you think she heard me ? So , what is a Smurfette ? No one wanted that answer more than Smurfette herself . What are you doing ? Hey , Grouchy , I was just ... Leaving ? This is my bench . I come here same time every day , and I ... Let me guess . \" And grouch . \" Exactly . I can do that . I can grouch . Hi , Grouchy . Hi , Smurfette . Nice day , huh ? No , it 's not . It 's gon na rain ! Which actually helps the plants grow . But also means it 's gon na be cloudy , so , chew on that . Then again , there might be a rainbow . But rainbows are dumb . Just kidding . I love rainbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya ? No , I 'm not . In fact , you 're actually kind of bad at it . Yup . But you 're also bad at it . That 's a lie . You 're really , really good at it . Hi , Brainy . Smurfette . Thank goodness you 're here . I was ... We 're running trials on my new invention . The Smurfy Thing Finder . Test subject , Hefty Smurf . Hey , Smurfette ! I mean ... - Hey , Smurfette . - Hey . That thing 's safe , right ? Is it safe ? Of course . I 'd get back here if I were you . Snappy Bug . Take this down . Smurfy Thing Finder trial 1.03 . - Ready , Hefty ? - Roger that . It works ! This thing really gets me . It 's able to hone in on Hefty 's dominant trait . Super strength . Which I distill into this . I call it Brainy 's Super Smurfy Power Fuel . Here , you can try it first . All clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like \" all clear , \" it makes me not want to ... Hey , guys . Hi , Clumsy . You 're just in time to witness scientific history . What 's going on in here ? None of your business , Nosey . Well , all right . Hey ! If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong , maybe it can tell me what an Ette is . Power it up , Brainy . Fascinating . What happened ? Somehow , instead of sending energy out , you absorbed it . Probably something to do with the fact that you 're not a real ... A real Smurf ? Go ahead , you can say it . No , no , I just meant that this machine was n't built for a Smurf of your , well , origins . Yeah , it 's okay . I get it . Brainy . Hey , you know what ? Let 's all go have some fun . Yeah ! - Pizza ! - Smurfboarding ! Smurfboarding ! It 's almost ready , Azrael . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from between the toes of a yak . And a piece of cheese I left in my underpants last week . That ought to do it . Presto ! Twelve spherical petrification modules . Or , as I like to call ' em , freeze balls . You 're welcome , Azrael . Dinner is served . Ingrate . Besides , these freeze balls are n't for catching mice . They 're for capturing those elusive Smurfs . My holy grail . The gold at the end of my rainbow . The most potent magical ingredient in the world . Next slide . Imagine the power in 100 of them combined . How I 've searched high and low , under every rock , it seems , with no sign of them anywhere . Not now , Azrael . I 'm in the middle of a lecture . My plan is simple . Find Smurf Village , capture all the Smurfs , drain them of their magic and , finally , use that magic to become the most powerful wizard in the world ! Look at me with hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place ? Blue blazes ! I 've spotted Smurfs in the forest ! Well , it 's my telescope . Monty ! Come , my majestic eagle . Your talons are digging into my shoulders . That 's better . Now , fly . Go capture me some Smurfs . No , no ! No , you 're going the wrong way ! Yeah ! Oh , no . My turn ! Safety third . Oh , boy . Yeah ! Really takes your breath away , does n't she ? This is incredible ! Oh , no ! She 's getting way too close to the Forbidden Forest . She ca n't go over that wall . Come on . No , no , no , wait . Do n't go . Wait . Wait , who are you ? Do n't be afraid . Hey , you ca n't go in there . - Smurfette ! - Smurfette ! - Smurfette , you okay ? - What happened ? What happened ? I saw a Smurf . - What ? - Who was it ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Code blue ! Guys , come on . We 've got ta get her . I have a bad feeling about this . Do you ? Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel 's lair ? Monty , my regal raptor . You 've done it , you 've caught a Smurf . Give me a kiss . Finally , you bring me what I 've been asking for . A tiny , blue-skinned , shirtless ... You ! Let me out of here , you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard . Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world ? I 'd prefer it if you just called me \" Papa . \" - I would never call you that . - Your loss . What 's this ? What are you hiding ? Hand it over , you pseudo-Smurf . Thank you , Azrael . What do we have here ? A different design ? Yes , of course , I noticed that right away . Slightly before you did , in fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not telling you anything . - Tell me . - No . - Tell me ! - No ! - You better tell me . - No ! - Fine . Do n't tell me . - I wo n't . Stupid reverse psychology never works . Who cares ? You 've already given me what I need . Come along , Azrael . Where on earth did I put those ingredients ? I know this . Go left , then right , back handspring , stick the landing . Is it a person , book or movie ? No one ever understands your hand signals , Hefty . Never mind . Just follow me and stay close . Wort of worm and hair of cat . Show me the home of this Smurf hat . Long have you searched for these creatures of blue . But this hat comes from somewhere new . Yes . Where ? Where does it come from ? A village of Smurfs , where enchantment grows . An entire village . Good . Go on . Go on . The location of which ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just start with that . Start with \" I do n't know . \" Lousy cheap-o cauldron . But here is a clue . Fascinating . But what is it ? Trees ? Must be a symbol for something , or a code . Trees , trees , breeze , knees . Babies crawl on their knees . Check all the nurseries in the area ! We 're going to need to disguise ourselves as babies . Now , where can I get a giant diaper ? Azrael , it 's not your map . You want your own map , we 'll get you your own map , but this is my ... Wait a minute . Look what I found . Three tall trees , in the Forbidden Forest . We 've never searched there before . I 'm a genius . Azrael , it 's time to take a road trip . Prepare my trail mix . Smurfette , congratulations . You 've just led me to an undiscovered population of Smurfs . They have no idea we even exist . I 'll be like ... They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" And I 'll be like ... And they 'll be like ... \" Run ! No ! Run , run , run ! \" You evil little genius . The rotten apple does n't fall too far from the tree after all . Does it ? Get your fur and feathers in gear , boys . We leave at first light . Right after breakfast , say 8:00 , 8:30 . 9:00 at the latest . - Wait , Brainy , the map . - I 'm on it . Fine , maybe 9:30 . Absolutely no later than 10:00 , though . - What the ... It 's a jailbreak ! - Go , go , go ! They know my plans . They 'll ruin everything ! Is this safe ? Well , it 's a giant crossbow , so I 'm gon na go with \" no . \" Do n't let them escape . - Where are the seat belts ? - Get them ! Get those Smurfs ! Fire in the hole ! Get those Smurfs ! Azrael 's gaining on us . Incoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on . Smurf this way . Run faster ! Run faster ! Why are our legs so short ? Why are our feet so big ? - Why are my muscles so big ? - Really , man ? Guys ! Guys ! A little help here . It 's coming . - Yes ! - All right ! Well , I know four Smurfs who have some explaining to do . - Oh , boy . - Hi . - Oh , my gosh . Papa , you will not believe it . - We ran into the Forbidden Forest . One at a time . One at a time . Please . Please . - Smurfette sees this mystery Smurf . - We have to go to the Forbidden Forest . I 've told you time and again , the Forbidden Forest is forbidden . And now you 're talking about maps and mystery Smurfs and Gargamel 's lair . None of this makes any sense , and I really do n't understand why you ca n't follow simple rules . You snuck out and it put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I can keep you safe is if ... You 're grounded . - Grounded ? No , not grounded ! - What ? No way ! - But , Papa , but ... - Come on ! No \" buts . \" None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you 're going . Do you understand that ? - You 're right , Papa . - What ? You 're right . I do n't know what we were thinking . Good . Because , as I was saying , you behaved completely irresponsibly . Yes . Right . Exactly . I could n't agree more . Right , guys ? - Yeah , right . - Yeah . Yeah , yeah . - What are you talking about , Smurfette ? - Okay . Yes , so ... And furthermore ... In fact , I think we should all go to our rooms right now and think about what we 've done . - Well , I think that 's ... - Tough , but fair . - Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , I 'm moving . - What 's your endgame here ? Did you get pecked on the noggin , Smurfette ? - Actually , Smurfette ... - Do n't worry , Papa . We are certainly going to do some thinking about what we did . And so forth . But we will definitely not be leaving our rooms until we 've thought this whole thing out . And then , just for good measure , we 'll think about it some more . Yes , but ... Great talk , Papa . I have no idea what I 'm doing . Hefty , I know that 's you . ' Sup , Smurfette ? Brainy . How did you do that ? And , I assume , Clumsy . - All good . - What are you guys doing out here ? We knew you were up to something . This is all my fault , Hefty . But , Smurfette , the Forbidden Forest ? It 's too dangerous . I have to at least warn that lost village . Well , we 're Team Smurf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming with you . I ca n't ask you to do that . - You did n't ask . - We volunteered . - Thanks , guys . - First things first . Bug technology . Cool . According to my map , we should be standing right in front of this very large , tall stone wall . Check . One small step for four small Smurfs ... Okay . Let us proceed . - Smurfette ! - You okay , Smurfette ? Nice flowers . Nice flowers . Not nice flowers ! Where 's Clumsy ? Hey ! We just met ! I 'm not that kind of Smurf . Watch out for the steep embankment . Clumsy , you okay ? I 'm seeing stars . Good work , Clumsy . You may have discovered a new subspecies of flying insectoid . Amazing ! A winged , fire-breathing Anisoptera . Let 's see . How should we classify this ? Maybe . I mean , seems like an easy choice , but I 'm just not sure . Yea , okay , let 's go with \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon . \" Nope ! Less \" fly ! \" Less \" fly ! \" Guys ! I 'm okay . A little help here . Monty , get off of me . I hate nature . How gaudy . Azrael , do something ! It 's quite painful . Stop laughing . This is not funny . Watch it ! Let me go ! These nests are made of some material I 've never seen before . You know , I think I 've had enough of these flying Antipastos for one day . Hey ! What are you doing here ? Well , I was thinking of getting a little place out here . Just a quiet place in the forest . It 's a little breezy up on the hill . What do you think I 'm doing out here ? You are never going to find that village , Gargamel . Smurfette , if it was n't for you , I would n't even know about those other Smurfs . - Get ' em , boys . - Smurfintine formation ! Go ! - Hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Smurfintine ! - Smurfintine ! - Smurfintine ! Smurfintine ! Hey , you . You 're the clumsy one , right ? Think fast . I caught it ! This is n't good . - Clumsy , give ' em back their egg ! - Okay . Oh , come on ! - Clumsy ! - I 'm trying ! I 'm really , really sorry , guys ! Over there ! I did n't mean to poach your egg . Well , they 're toast . It does n't matter . What 's a few worthless pennies when there 's a pot of gold at the end of my rainbow ? Trust me , they 're goners . I 'm telling you , they 've been fried to a blue crisp . They 're Smurf kabobs . Smurfberry flambe . Marshmallows . Can it , fuzzball . They 're dead . Dead , I say ! Hello ? Smurfette ? Echo ! Darkness . I do n't do well in the darkness . I have enough trouble in the daylight . Hold on , everyone . We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thinking , \" Brainy . \" - Guys ? - Darkness ! Do n't be scared . Just ... Just think happy thoughts . It 's not really happy times right now ! - Just stay in the light , Clumsy . - Too late . I 'm walking into the darkness ! What are you ... Why ? I 'm really freaking out , you guys ! Stop , everyone . Okay , go into your backpacks , get out your emergency tunnel survival kit , find the small glass vial marked \" light , \" and shake it really hard . Clumsy ? How you doing ? Okay , I guess . Just hang tight , Clumsy . I 'm not sure how long this will take or how long we 'll be down here , so , everybody , whatever you do , do n't eat all your rations . I just ate all my rations ! - Clumsy ! - I 'm stress-eating ! I 'm coming , Clumsy . Follow the sound of my voice . Wait ! These tunnels are like a maze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got ta do something . I 'm with her . Time for some action . We 're doing this all wrong . Smurfette ! I 'm close , Clumsy . Almost there . That 's just the echo playing tricks on us . - Anybody ? - I 'm here . I 'm here right around this corner . Hey , everybody ? My light is going out . That is it ! I 'm punching us out of here . It 's collapsing . Hefty ! Put those fists away before you get us killed ! At least I 'm trying something . - I 'm gon na blow us out of here ! - No ! - Oh , yeah ! - Do n't ! Too late ! Clumsy ? - Hey , Smurfette . - Clumsy ! Hang on . I 'm coming , Clumsy bro . I got you , little buddy . Yeah ! Stampede ! I think my rations are coming up . What ? What 's so funny ? Now , that 's what I call \" talking out of your butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in knowing that we 're in sight of three tall trees ? - All right . - Yeah , we are . And Bucky is gon na get us there extra fast . - Bucky ? - Seems like a Bucky to me . Hit it , Bucky ! Smurfette ? Before you say anything , just listen . Now , I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys , and I know there are times I 'm a little overprotective . Okay , a lot overprotective . But you have to understand , you snuck out . You have to be more careful . Smurfette , I know lately you may not realize , and I may not say it enough , but you are ... You shine . So , anyway , we 're smurfy ? I think you and the boys have been grounded long enough . Smurfette ? Okay . I 'm opening the door . And I 'm walking in to talk more . You there ? Smurfette . Hefty ! Brainy ! Clumsy ! That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ground them for a month of blue moons . What 's going on in here ? Well , all right . Have you ever seen something so beautiful ? Every day , Smurfette . Every day . - Do n't be weird . - You do n't be weird . We can camp here for the night . I 'll start us a fire . Fetch me some firewood , would you , Hefty ? A \" please \" would be nice . Yes , it would , but I have n't earned my manners badge , so get me some firewood . Clumsy ? You okay ? Yeah , sure . It 's been fun . Well , not tons of fun , but it 's had its moments . Kind of . You know what I 'm trying to say . It has n't been that much fun . Well done , Hefty . Well done . All right , step one , the wood should be stacked into a tepee-like structure . Step two , I tap this flint with a rock and ... You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That 's odd . Perhaps the wood you collected was damp , Hefty . According to my manual , it should spark right up . Hey , I 've got an idea . No , no , no . No , no ! No ! No , no , no . No , no , no ! You know , you 're right , Brain Man . Your little book does come in handy . Shame . Shame on you . We 'd be lost without this book . My name is Brainy . I 'm super smart . I 'm the smart Smurf . But I ca n't start a fire . Okay , the damage is minimal . The binding 's still intact . It smells good . Just think , guys . After all this time , while we 've been going about our smurfy business back home , there 's been other Smurfs out there , just like us . Or they could be nothing like us . He 's right . We should be prepared for whatever we find . Those other Smurfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange . I like orange . What if they all wear glasses ? Or have big , bushy mustaches . What if they have scaly skin and sharp teeth ? And giant claws . And big , beady eyes . What if they have hands ? Good one , bro . Listen , it does n't matter what they look like . We still have to warn them . Gargamel 's wrong about me . It 's not my purpose to help him . I 'm meant to save those Smurfs . And we 're gon na help you . We 're Team Smurf , and we 're in this together . And by \" together , \" I mean me and you . And those guys . But mostly me and you . Okay , everyone . Smurfy selfie time . - Say , \" Blue cheese . \" - Blue cheese ! According to the map , we should be arriving at a river . Check . It 's like a workout for my eyeballs . Okay , Bucky , let 's see how fast you can swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's a little water ? Hey . What 's that , Bucky ? The river 's unsafe and full of dangerous surprises at every bend ? No . I did n't get any of that . Perhaps Glowbunnies do n't swim . That 's too bad . We 'd get there so much faster . Fear not , my intrepid Team Smurf . I did n't earn this raft-building merit badge for nothing . - Nailed it . - Impressive , Brainy . Here . Stylish and practical . Now , let 's launch this bad boy . Wait . Remember , this strange river may hold untold surprises . - We must be cautious . - Cautious . Good point . - And heave ... - Wait . The currents can be unpredictable . We must be alert and vigilant . Vigilance ? Good call . - Now , on three , two ... - Wait ! We must make sure we always ... Pay attention to the ... Rate of speed of the ... Okay , and we are off . Heave-ho ! - Bye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry , we 'll be fine . - Bye , little Bucky bro . - Hasta la bunny . - See you on the way back ! Hey . What is this thing ? I would n't touch that if I were you . Now all I want to do is touch it . At this pace , Gargamel does n't stand a chance . Look . If we follow this river , we 'll be right on course . Right on course . To the end of our rainbow . Smurfs ? I thought I left you for dead . Hang on , Smurf Crew . Gun it ! What the ... No . Stop ruining things . Ruining things is my thing . What ? Azrael , get me a bigger stick . Oh , dear . Clumsy , pull the lever ! Seriously ? But you said not to . Is this a trick ? Pull it now ! Oh , no . What 's this ? Azrael ! Do something . It 's never gon na stop . Make the log stop spinning . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two . - Yes ! We did it ! - We did it ! - See , I always believed we would do it . - Take that ! Help ! Help ! All right . We 're still on course . Double-time it , Hefty . Help ! I 'm sinking ! Please . I 'm afraid of turtles ! Guys , what 's he up to now ? - Help ! - Forget that guy . My cat ca n't swim . We got ta help him . - Are you crazy ? Why ? - Because it 's what I do . - Listen to him ! - But he 's our sworn enemy . He is literally a villain . I can change ! And I literally wear my heart on my sleeve , okay ? - That 's your shoulder , not a sleeve . - I like your tattoo ! - We 're doing this . - Smurfette , talk some sense into him . Brainy , I hate Gargamel more than anyone , but we 're Smurfs . - We do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to save him . I just want to go on record that I 'm decisively against this . - Whatever . We 're doing it . - Sounds awesome ! - Use this . - Grab on ! I do n't know about this . You wo n't regret it . Thank you . Thank you . Such a kind Smurf . - Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . Wet , a little tired , kind of waterlogged . Thanks for asking , but ... I 'm still evil , so ... Enjoy drowning . Hope you 're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards ' character . Brainy . Hefty ? You okay ? Define \" okay . \" - Where 's Clumsy ? - Clumsy ! - Clumsy ! Clumsy ! - Clumsy ! Clumsy ! I 'm good . - Run away ! Run away ! - Hey . I think . My pack ! My manual ! No ! No , no , no ! No , no , no ! My Scout manual ! This is all your fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry . Correction . This is your fault , too . Leave her out of this . Hefty , I do n't need you to fight my fights for me . Wait , now you 're mad at me , too ? Smurfette , you 're the one that got us into this whole mess in the first place . Hey , I was ready to do this on my own . Great . So much for Team Smurf . - I want to yell about something ! - Stay out of this , Clumsy . That 's it , Brain Man . It 's time for you to earn your manners badge . Stop it ! Take cover ! Who are you ? What do you want ? Her . - Move . - Smurfette ! - What should we do with her ? - Look at that hair . - Where 's she from ? - And that dress . It 's you . You 're a girl . She 's a girl . This is her . This is the Smurf I was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's real ? I 'm Smurflily . Hi . I 'm Smurfette . Oh , my geez-to-petes ! I 'm Smurfblossom . Nice to meet you . We do n't have a Smurfette . But we do have Smurfpetal , Smurfclover , Smurfmeadow , Smurfdaisy , Smurfholly , Smurfhazel ... Hey . Everyone can just introduce themselves later . Look at you . You 're so different . I mean , sorry , but it 's true . Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick ? I do . I can show you . Actually , Smurfstorm can show you . She 's the best at that kind of thing . Right , Stormy ? That means \" yes . \" Have you ever seen a rainbow ? What about a double rainbow ? What about an upside down rainbow ? So , is your favorite song ... Hey , hey , hey Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ' Cause mine is . Your dress is so pretty . Smurfblossom , remember , work on that filter , okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your deal anyway ? Well , we came to warn you about Gargamel . - Garga ? - Garga ? Garga-what ? He 's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all Smurfs and use them for his evil magic . And he knows about your lost village . \" Lost village \" ? You 're the one's who are lost , not us . We have to take you to Smurfy Grove . What do we do with these blue blobs ? Bring them along . Come on , Smurfette . I 'm gon na show you my room . You can tell me all about Gargasmell . But first , do you want to hear my favorite song again ? Hey , hey , hey Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey All right , move . - Girl Smurfs mean business . - You got that right . Open the gate ! The girls are back ! Where did they find them ? Is there something wrong with them ? - Are they sick ? - Are they food ? No , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except , well , they 're boy Smurfs . \" Boy . \" That 's a funny word . Boy . Boy . Boy . Boy . Look at me . I 'm a boy Smurf . - I like ' em . - Where do they come from ? - What is that ? - Look at their hair . - You can see their tails . - Look . - Hey , watch it ! - Brainy 's log , day two . We 've encountered a rare new life-form . Are there more like you ? They are at times very intimidating . - Are you gon na stay here ? - And they smell nice . - Hello , boy . - More on that later . - I want one ! - Boundaries ! Okay , that ... That 's enough of that ! They 're my friends . That 's Hefty , Brainy and Clumsy . - Hey , there ! - Hooptie , Berney , Klutzy . Got it . We should do name tags . Wait , where are your boys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smurfwillow , leader of the Smurfs . This is called an introduction . So , now , you go . - I ... - Do n't get too close , Willow . Something 's not right here . I promise we 're only here to help . We came to warn you about the evil wizard , Gargamel . He has a map with a landmark leading him to three tall trees . - Show ' em , Brainy . - Snappy . Do n't try any funny stuff , bug . I hate to break it to you , but those are n't trees . They 're waterfalls . Gargamel 's going the wrong way . And if he went there , then that means the Swamp of No Return . There 's no way he could survive . Help me ! Help me ! There 's no way I 'll survive ! With all due respect , you do n't know Gargamel . Yeah , well , with no due respect , you do n't know us . Trust us , he 's a goner . Stormy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things out . And leave you here with these four ? No way . Look at that one . He ca n't be normal . I think we 'll be just fine here . Spitfire ! Okay . So , what does this Gargamel look like ? You know , he 's your typical wizard . Long black robe , lives alone with his cat and his bird . It 's sad , really . You 're coming with me . You can point him out . Hey . There 's no way he 's getting on a ... I feel the need to remind you , my name is Clumsy . Clumsy ! Do n't worry . Clumsy 's in good hands . Stormy is the sweetest , in her own way . All right , girls , in the meantime , our guests have had a long journey , so let 's show them some hospitality , Smurfy Grove style . Come on . Go . Hey , Smurfette , check this out . Come on ! Flap , Monty . Flap vigorously . Use your mighty condor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're bottom feeders ! Devil fish ! Where is my lost Smurf village ? What ? Smurfs ! Why wo n't they just die ? Monty , retrieve them ! He exists , all right . He and his stinky cat and his dodo bird . They 've been terrorizing us the entire journey . He did n't like us from the start . He never could find our village . So then he made a plan to capture us all , and that 's when Gargamel created Smurfette . - Anyways ... - Hold up . Smurfette was created by this Gargamel ? Yeah . From a lump of clay . Really cool story , actually . I knew I did n't trust her . You 'd like her if you get to know her . She 's just like you , but nice . Hold on . We got a bogey coming in . That 's no bogey . That 's Gargamel 's big dumb bird ! Here , you fly . That 's not a great idea . Flying 's not really my thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , then how do you know it 's not your thing ? He 's coming back . - What do I ... - Hurry ! What do I do now ? Good move ! - Now , do it again ! - Okay . Thanks . Yes . Wait a minute . I do n't recognize that other Smurf . They found my lost Smurf village . Hey , I 've got an idea . Spitfire , spit fire ! I like the way you think . I guess I 'm pretty good with dragonflies after all . Monty ! What have they done to you , my glorious bird of prey ? Smurfs ! Shiatsu or Swedish ? Probably Swedish . So , about all that stuff I said back at the beach ... I guess I kind of overreacted . Yeah . Me , too . So , we good ? - Yeah , we 're good . - Hey , guys . Is n't this place awesome ? Does n't she look great ? It 's like she 's one of us now . She should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . And two , this is getting a little out of hand , do n't you think ? Sorry . I ca n't take you seriously with that mask on your face . Hey , Smurfette , we did what we came here to do . These Smurfs know about Gargamel . So , come on , let 's start thinking about heading home . Home ? But I ... It 's time to go . Smurfette ? Incoming ! Turns out I do do well with dragonflies . They were right . This Gargamel character , he 's real , and he 's headed this way . Oh , no . See ? I told you ... Put a cork in it , Smurfette . The way I see it , you and your little boyfriends led him straight to us . But , of course , that was your plan all along , was n't it ? Smurfstorm , easy . Little Miss Yellow Hair is n't even a real Smurf . She was created by Gargamel . The Clumsy blob told me so himself . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . She was made to help him find Smurfs . Smurfette came here to help you . We all did . It 's okay , Hefty . This is all my fault . Girls , protection mode . Come on , bro , let 's help . Is n't this exciting ? Hold . Hold . Now ! Surrender , wizard . What ? Wizard ? He 's so old . - Is he wearing a disguise ? - Look at his face . This is impossible . He does n't seem so tough . Yeah , Gargamel ! That 's what you get when you attack Smurfy Grove . - Gargamel ? What are you talking about ? - No , no , no , wait . This is a mistake . - What ? - Smurfette ? That 's Papa . - Papa ? - Papa ? There 's another funny word . Papa . Papa . Papa ! Smurfblossom , no . Breathe deep and step away from the Papa-thing . Everyone , meet Papa Smurf . Hey . - Hey . - Hi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sup , Papa ? - Hello there . I rode a dragonfly ! Well , thank goodness you 're all okay . How did you find us ? I was n't born yesterday , you know . Yeah , that 's clear . Look , you four are coming home with me . Now . Not so fast , Papa-thing . \" Papa-thing \" ? Are you the one in charge here ? That 's right . I 'm Smurfwillow , leader of the Smurfs . I 'm afraid that 's quite impossible , because I happen to be the leader of the Smurfs . Whatever you say , Papa-thing . Excuse me , do you mind not calling me that ? Well , if the thing fits ... By the way , where 'd you learn those moves ? Self-taught , actually . Impressive . Thank you . You 're quite welcome . Okay , not really sure what 's happening here , but what about Gargamel ? What ? What is all this talk about Garga ... Gargamel ! I 'm sorry . Did I scare you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody run ! - Arm yourselves ! Prepare for Garmageddon ! This way ! Spears , now ! Gargamel says freeze ! That 's right . Smurf-tested , Gargamel-approved , grade-A , first-class , high-octane freeze balls . Freeze ball ! Freeze ball ! Freeze ball ! Freeze ball ! Look out ! Well , I assume they 'll still work if I do n't shout \" freeze ball , \" but we 'll never know . - Freeze ball ! - Smurfette ! - Hefty . - It 's over , Smurfette . Monty , bag o ' Smurfs . It 's time for you to run . - No ! - Three more for pickup . Smurfette . My little creation . You finally did what you were made for . No . It 's not true . Of course it is . Why do you think you led me here ? Why do you think you saved me on the river ? It was all part of the plan . No matter how hard you try , you ca n't escape your destiny . And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freeze ball ! Yes , these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs . And you are nothing more than a lump of clay . Thank you for everything . Smurfette ? How could you do this to us ? Because it was her purpose . Smurfy Thing Finder for four small Smurfs . I 'm sorry , you guys . No , Snappy . I 've done too much damage already . We 're Team Smurf , and we 're in this together . We 're Smurfs . We do the right thing . I 'm not even a real Smurf . I 'm not a real Smurf . We need more power ! Faster , Monty . Faster . Yes . The jiggler 's jiggling . The spinny thing is spinning . The smoke is going up . The bubblers are bubbling . Perfect ! It 's almost there . Just keep running , old bird . Here 's what we 're going to do . - I pick this lock . - Yeah ? - We swing to that shelf . - Yeah ? - Pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the bird ! - Yeah ! What ? - Yeah ! Wait . You want us to kill the bird ? Fine . We 'll just knock him unconscious . - Genius ! - All right , then . Let 's do this . They have an escape plan , but they 're going to need our help . It 's time to rock the cage . Do n't be weird . Yes ! Okay . Now ! Stop that , Azrael . I ca n't calibrate my machine with all your incessant yammering . Yes , Azrael , listen to it . It purrs like a kitten . Look at that . Everything is in sync . Yes , yes . Good . Sweet mercy ! It 's another jailbreak ! - No , Gargamel . No . - Quiet down . You 'll all get your turn . In you go ! No ! Yes , that 's the stuff . It 's working , it 's working , it 's working I can feel it . I can feel the power . Check out my wizard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these Smurfs , I 'll have all the power I 've ever dreamed of ! Almost all the power . Smurfette . Smurfette , what a lovely surprise . Are you done crying in the woods ? I 've shed enough tears for those Smurfs . What 's this ? I 'm done pretending to be something I 'm not . I 've come to repledge my loyalty to you , my true Papa . - Impossible . - She ca n't be serious . No , no , no , she would never . Even if I did believe you , which I do n't , what could you possibly offer me that I do n't already have ? A tiny little massage that I ca n't even feel ? How about the rest of the Smurfs ? Yeah , right . Wait , what ? Just think of all the power you 'll have once I reveal the location of Smurf Village . Let 's see now . One hundred more Smurfs , that 's ten times the power ... No . If you carry the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , why are you doing this ? I 'm so tired of being good . Use your power to transform me back to my evil self . Your loyalty has returned to you . So , do we have a deal ? Smurfette , no ! Quiet , you vile blue rats . I 'm thinking . Okay , I 'm done . Let 's do it . One evil Smurfette coming right up ! Wait . Of course ! What ? What 's happening ? No ! No ! What are you doing ? Yeah ! Go , Smurfette ! Azrael , help ! More power ! What are we going to do ? Bingo . We Smurfboard . Team Smurf ! Payback time . No ! Smurfintine ! Smurfintine ! I 'm okay . Yeah ! I thought we were goners . All right . Everybody . Thank goodness . - All right ! - I 'm okay ! She did it ! She did it ! Where 's Smurfette ? Hey . Smurfette ? What happened ? This is what she once was . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something I can do . There 's got ta be a spell . There 's got ta be something . I know there is . Where is it ? What page ? Must be here . \" Alchemy , vanishing , lead into gold . \" No , that 's not it . - Papa . - Which spell ? Which spell ? Papa . We wo n't find the answer to this in a book . Let 's take her home . She never thought she was a real Smurf . But she was the truest Smurf of all . Why is everyone crying ? It 's Smurfette . She 's a lump of clay . No , Clumsy , it 's me . I 'm right here . Smurfette ? It 's Smurfette . It 's Smurfette ! - Quiet , Clumsy . - Let him be , Brainy . We all grieve in our own way . - She 's here ! - Poor little bro . I know how he feels . Yeah ! Smurfette ! Hefty , not you , too . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . I wo n't . I promise . Yes , yes , yes ! You never cease to amaze me . So , as for that burning question ... What 's a Smurfette ? Well , I do n't need a book to tell you she 's ... Right . Smurfette ca n't be defined by just one word . She 's many things . She does n't know it yet , but she 's my new best friend . Smurfette is a bunny wrangler . She 's tough . Not as tough as me , but tough enough . Smurfette can be anything she wants to be . - What 's going on in there ? - Goodbye ! Say , \" Blue cheese ! \" Blue cheese ! I was this close to getting rid of the Smurfs , and you ruined everything . I knew I should have gotten a dog from the shelter . I 'm not saying this to be cruel , okay ? I 'm saying it to be constructive . You 're a useless feline . That 's just mean . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed it . I was just jib-jabbing , and you crossed that line , and that stung . I demand an apology . You were going to learn this one way or another , but I am not your real father . But that does n't matter now . What matters is destroying the Smurfs . Any thoughts ? I mean , I have thoughts . But I always like to spitball off of your thoughts . Azrael , I 'm not going to sugarcoat this . Your ideas are terrible . I ca n't think with this music . Can someone please shut off the music ? And what 's with all these words scrolling in front of me ? Did the Smurfs do this so that I would be distracted and not be able to destroy them as easily ? \" Matte painters \" ? I do n't even know what that means . Someone just made that up , right ? I feel sorry for whoever \" Matte \" is . \" Look development artists \" ? Yes , of course , let 's develop some looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two totally ruined my plans . Am I going mad , Azrael ? For the last time , get them to shut off this music ! \n"
